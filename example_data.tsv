Here was a pretty accident indeed! If Walter Dene had   been a common heartless murderer he would have snatched   up the knife immediately, left the poor lame dog to watch   and bleed beside his dead master, and skulked off hurriedly   from the mute witness to his accomplished crime. Hut   Walter was made of very different mould from that ;   he could not find it in his heart to leave a poor dumb animal   M 177     THE CURATE OF CHURNSIDE     wounded and bleedinjj for hours together, alone and untended. Just at first, indeed, he tried so})histically to   persuade himself his duty to Cliristina demanded that he   should go away at once, and never mind the sufferings of a   mere spaniel ; but his better nature told him the next   moment that such sophisms were indefensible, and his   humane instincts overcame even the profound instinct of   self-preservation. He sat down quietly beside the warm   corpse. 'Thank goodness,' he said, with a slight shiver of   disgust, * I 'm not one of those weak-minded people who are   troubled by remorse. They would be so overcome by terror   at what they had done that they would want to run away   from the body immediately, at any price. But I don't think   I could feel remorse. It is an incident of lower natures —   natures that are capable of doing actions under one set of   impulses, which they regret when another set comes uppermost in turn. That implies a want of balance, an imperfect   co-ordination of parts and passions. The perfect character   is consistent with itself; shame and repentance are confessions of weakness. For my part, I never do anything   without having first deliberately decided that it is the best   or the only thing to do ; and having so done it, I do not   draw back like a girl from the necessary consequences of my   own act. No fluttering or running away for me. Still, I   must admit that all that blood does look very ghastly.   Poor old gentleman ! I believe he really died almost without knowing it, and that is certainly a great comfort to one   under the circumstances.'     He took King Charlie tenderly in his hands, without   touching the wounded leg, and drew his pocket handkerchief softly from his pocket. ' Poor beastie,' he said   aloud, holding out the cut limb before him, ' you are badly   hurt, I 'm afraid ; but it wasn't my fault. We must see   what

The inmates of the cottage were greatly relieved at this turn of affairs, and immediately set   before thc'r visitor some dried beef, and the   best that the log-house would afford. Having   satisfied his appetite, he curled himself up like a   dog, and throwing his skin over him, sunk into a   profound slumber on the floor.

The Indian opened his eyes, and observing the   dulness of his hostess and her daughter, in the   rude Indian manner seemed anxious to learn   the cause of their grief, which a few words were   sufficient to explain, owing to the natural sagacity of the Indian. Immediately, the savage,   after his fashion, became a comforter, and   vowed he would bring her husband back dead   or alive, and seizing his arms, instantly left the   cottage.

On Sunday,   however, the rain poured in torrents ; so much so, that   the guides were of the opinion that there would be little   chance of being able to get by the Echo river for ten   days or a fortnight, so that on Monday I resumed my   journey.

Ah, little do we know, while we slumber, how many a   source of sorrow is being opened up, and how many a dark   deed and deeply laid stratagem are being formed and fulfilled.     The hour of their departure had nearly approached.   Katie arose from her couch, adjusted her garments in order   to avoid detection, and in readiness awaited the signal   of her lover. This was a serious moment for consideration. The good and the evil spirit contended alike for   the mastery of her affections. '^ Shall I leave my father,   or shall I not ?"" whispered the voice of her heart. "" Oh !   I cannot go,"" she exclaimed to herself. At that moment   a gentle tap on the window was heard, and a voice more   soft and musical than the singing of sylvan waters, whispered affectionately to her car. It was that of her lover.   His very presence strengthened the weaker parts of her   heart ; with him she resolved to go ; and with the hope of   visiting her father at no distant day she endeavored to   allay for the present the anxiety of her mind.     She stepped softly into the room to take a silent farewell   of her sleeping parent. There he lay in calm, heavenly   composure, the moonbeams, from the window, playing   gently over his care-worn features, around which hung   the hoary locks of three-score years. She gazed for a   moment upon him ; her heart filled with emotion. Fain   would she have impressed his lips with her own, and imbued them with the fragrance of her heart.

All in nature was calm, beautiful, and romantic, a scene that the   eye of fancy be ""^mes enamored with.

The soldier persisted to demand prompt payment, threatening him with a beating, if he refused. Even the threat of being struck is ever insupportable to an Indian.  HISTORY OF THE WESTERN STATES. 85 The old man sprang incensed from the fort, and challenged the soldier to single combat. The soldier, alarmed by the rage of the Indian, cried Murder ! The warrior on this, and seeing a crowd collecting, retired slowly towards his village. One of the guard fired upon him, and he was mortally wounded. No inquiry was made, or at least no punishment inflicted on him who had committed the outrage. “All the revengeful feelings, natural to savages, were called up on the occasion. The Natchez flew to arms, and the French were assailed on every side, and many of them fell. The Stung Serpent, an influential chief, interposed his authority, and the slaughter ceased. A new treaty of peace was the result of the discussion that ensued, and the whole affair seemed to be buried in oblivion. “ Soon after this, in the year 1723, under different pretexts, several hundred soldiers were secretly introduced into the settlement, and the defenceless and unsuspecting Natchez slaughtered in their huts. The head of the first chief was demanded as the price of peace, and the wretched Natchez were obliged to yield to the demand. The slaughter had continued four days, before peace was granted them. This was a deed, of course, never to be forgotten nor forgiven by the savages. They saw at once, that there now remained no alternative were 8  86 IIISTORY OF THE WESTERN STATES. between their own destruction or that of their enemies. They were moody, pensive, timid and slow; but they were sure in devising the means of vengeance. Things remained in this situation until 1729. At this time, M. de Chopart, who had been the chief agent in these transactions, and who was excessively obnoxious to the savages, had been ordered to New Orleans, to meet an investigation of his conduct touching this affair. The joy of the savages was great; for they hoped, at least, to be delivered from his enmity and oppression. To their despair, they learned that he was justified, and reinstated in his authority. He seemed, on his return, more vindictive towards them than ever. To manifest his ill feelings, he determined to build a town, two miles below the present site of Natchez, on ground occupied by a large and ancient village of the Indians. Accordingly, he sent for the Sun chief, and ordered him to have the savage huts cleared away, and the inhabitants dispersed. The chief replied, that their ancestors had dwelt there for ages; and that it was good that their descendants should dwell there after them. The order was repeated, with a threat of destruction, if not obeyed. “ The Indians dissembled ; and, remarking that the corn had just come out of the ground, and that their hens were

On leaving the piece of wood to which he had been clinging, however, the boy was so much exhausted that he sunk below the water and lost his hold. At the same time Mr Thomson, unaccustomed to manage a swimming horse, turned the animal too suddenly round, by which it lost its balance, and disappeared, along with its rider, the tide closing over them. A scream of despair now burst from the shore, and in an instant a number of men rushed by a kind of instinctive impulse into the The agitation of my mind at that moment was dreadful beyond description. Not knowing what I did, I pulled the rope rapidly to land, as if it had still been held by the unfortunate boy, and then, finding that I had been labouring in vain, I was on the point of plunging again into the sea, when I was brought to my senses, by an universal shout of joy which echoed along the beach. ' This was occasioned by the reappearance of the good minister, who emerged with his horse from the water without being dismounted, and was borne amidst the congratulations of his flock, safely to land. The situation of the poor youth, however, now seemed absolutely hopeless; but I determined to make one desperate attempt to save him. Accordingly tying the rope, which I held in my hand, round my middle, and committing it to the care of some persons who were within reach, I threw myself into the water. By an effort which nothing but despair could have enabled me to make, waves.  240 THE COTTAGE FIRESIDE. 99 1 I reached the body, now deprived of all animation, and clasping it in my arms, I was dragged to shore with my prize. When I recovered myself, for I was almost in a state of insensibility, I observed the minister actively engaged in giving directions respecting the management of the body, which I now discovered to be really that of my nephew George. To account for Mr Thomson's appearance on the shore, it may be proper to mention, that as he returned from church, he had observed the crowd, and judging from the unusual bustle, that some person was in the act of drowning, he ordered his horse to be saddled and hastened to the spot, after having, with admirable presence of mind, given directions for some necessary preparations in the house, and ordered a servant to follow him with a blanket and a leaf of the barn door to serve as a kind of litter. The body, when well dried, was covered with the servant's warm shirt and waistcoat, which at his master's desire he threw off for that purpose, and being wrapped in the blanket and placed on the door, was conveyed on the shoulders of four men at a rapid pace to the

[chAP. “Please ma'am, Madam Belamour, I wishes you joy with all my heart. Please can't I do nothing for you? Shall I help you undress, or brush your hair?” Perhaps she expected a largesse in honour of the occasion, but Aurelia had spent all her money on Christmas gifts, and had nothing to bestow. However, she found on the breakfast-table a parcel addressed to Madam Belamour, containing a purse with a startling amount of golden guineas in it. She was rather surprised at the title, which was one generally conferred on dignified matrons whose husbands were below the rank of knighthood, such as the wives of country squires and of the higher clergy. The calling her mother Madam Delavie had been treated as an offence by Lady Belamour; and when the day had gone by, with nothing else to mark it from others, Aurelia, finding her recluse in what she mentally called his quiet rational mood, ventured, after thanking him, modestly to inquire whether that was what she was to be called. “It is better thus,” he said. “You have every right to the title.” She recollected that he was a baronet's younger son, a distinction in those days; and that she had been told that his patent of knighthood had been made out, though he had never been able to appear at court to receive the accolade, and had never assumed the title; so she only said “Very well, sir, I merely thought whether my Lady would think it presuming.”  xx.] THE MUFFLED BRIDEGROOM. 215 He laughed a little. “My Lady will soon anderstand it,” he said. “Her husband will be at home in a few weeks. And now, my dear Madam Belamour,” he added, playfully, “tell me whether there is any wish that I can gratify.” “You are very kind, sir——” “What does that pause mean, my fair friend?” “I fear it is too much to ask, sir, but since you inquire what would please me most, it would be if you could spare me to go to my sister Harriet's wedding ?” * “My child,” he said, with evident regret, “I fear that cannot be. It will not be prudent to make any move until Mr. Wayland's return; but after that I can assure you of more liberty. Meantime, let us consider what wedding present you would like to send her.” Aurelia had felt her request so audacious that she subsided easily; and modestly suggested a tea-service. She thought of porcelain, but Mr. Belamour's views were of silver, and it ended in the lady giving the cups and saucers, and the gentleman the urn and the tea and coffee pots and other plate; but it was a drawback to the pleasure of this munificence that the execution of the order had to be entrusted to Mr. Hargrave.

Surely it is much better to let their natural affections have time to expand. If we tear the rosebud open we spoil the flower.” Belinda smiled at this parable of the rosebud, which, she said, might be applied to men and women, as well as to children. “And yet, upon reflection,” said Lady Anne, “the heart has nothing in common with a rosebud.

Belinda was silent; but, after a pause, she said, “That it was certainly very dangerous, especially for women, to trust to fancy in bestowing their affections.” “And yet,” said Lady Anne, “it is a danger to which they are much exposed in society. Men have it in their power to assume the appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable, and women have scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit.” “Without Ithuriel's spear, how can they distinguish the good from the evil?” said Belinda. “This is a common-place complaint, I know; the ready excuse that we silly young women plead, when we make mistakes for which our friends reproach us, and for which we too often reproach ourselves.” “The complaint is common-place precisely because it is general and just,” replied Lady Anne. “In the slight and frivolous intercourse, which fashionable belles usually have with those fashionable beaux who call themselves their lovers, it is surprising that they can discover any thing of each other's real character. Indeed they seldom do; and this probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy marriages. A woman who has an opportunity of seeing her lover in private society, in domestic life, has infinite advantages; for if she has any sense, and he has any sincerity, the real character of both may perhaps be developed.” “True,” said Belinda (who now suspected that Lady Anne alluded to Mr. Vincent); “and in such a situation a woman would readily be able to decide whether the man who addressed her would suit her taste or not; so she would be inex BELINDA, 233 cusable if, either from vanity or coquetry, she disguised her real sentiments.” “And will Miss Portman, who cannot, by any one to whom she is known,

Lord Arranmore's first glance at Bog Moy convinced him that there, at least, nothing had been changed. The morass or boggy plain, in which it stood, was as unreclaimed, as when he had last shot snipes upon it, within paces of the house. In the midst of its brown surface appeared the only verdant spot in the demesne, a horsepond in its “mantle of green.” There still flourished, or decayed, a few old stunted trees, called the Orchard or “Avalgort,” with a mound covered with furze, called the “ Fin avain,"" or Vinery.* There too mouldered the ancient Dovecote: and the well of a sweet water,” under its vaulted arch of rudely cut stone: a wall of stone or clay encompassed the bawn, (a square of two hundred feet, the only pleasure-ground, which in former times "" the unquiet state of the land” permitted to the gentry of Ireland. Up to the commencement of the last century, the flocks of the most wealthy landholders were attended by armed herdsmen, who with spears for crooks, took their watch in the morning upon some high crag, to spy the neighbouring enemy, and at night drove their charge into the bawn, which afforded shelter alike for man and for beast. The bawn had been flanked by four square towers; one of which was in good preservation, and distinguished by the name of the Brigadier's Tower. Not so the mansion. Since Lord Arranmore had seen it, it had become confusion worse confounded; preserving the remains of all the various changes from its first erection of “cage-work and couples,"" through its progress of clay and stone and lime,"" a castle began,"" and a modern mansion never finished. On the outside of the bawn walls, rose a cluster of hovels, whose smoke rolled in masses from their chimnies down upon the road. These were the remains of the dwellings of tenants “planted and estated on the land,"" who had once been returned as constituting eleven families able to make twenty-five men at arms, and now the shelter of a band of Miss Mac Taaf's cottiers or under-tenants.

And I think two or three weeks only had passed, after he was in it, when news reached him of his wife's death. It came from his agent in New York, Abraham B. Whitter, who had received the information from San Francisco. Mr. Whitter enclosed the San Francisco letters. They were written by a Mr. Munn: one letter to himself, the other (which was as yet not unsealed) to Nash Caromel. We read them both: Nash brought them to the Squire before sending them to Mrs. Tinkle-considerate as ever, he would not let her see them until she had been prepared. The letters did not say much. Mrs. Nash Caromel had grown weaker and weaker after Nash departed from San Francisco for New York, and she finally sank under low fever. A diary, which she had kept the last few weeks of her life, meant only for her husband's own eye, together with a few letters and sundry other personal trifles, would be forwarded the first opportunity to Abraham B.

She was not well enough to travel with me.” “Well-look here, Caromel-don't go and marry that other Charlotte,"" advised the Squire. “She is as different from your wife as chalk is from cheese. Poor thing! it was a hard fate-dying over there away from everybody!"" But now—would anybody believe it?-instead of taking the Squire's advice and not marrying her at all, instead even of allowing a decent time to elapse, in less than a week Nash went to church with Charlotte the Second. Shame, said Parson Holland under his breath; shame, said the parish aloud; but Nash Caromel heeded them not. We only knew it on the day before the wedding was to be. On Wednesday morning, a fine, crisp, October day, a shooting party was to meet at old Appleton's, who lived over beyond Church Dykely. The Squire and Tod started for it after an early breakfast, and they let me go part of the way with them.

Cumberland, was one evening behind the scenes of Drurylane theatre, during the performance of his own “West Indian,” in which Mr. Elliston played Belcour, and was introduced, as the representative of that character, to Mr. C. who lavished the most extravagant encomiums upon his performance. When he had left the Green Room, to pursue his duties, Mr. Cumberland turned round to a gentleman, who stood at his elbow, and with a sarcastic grin, “ Pray, sir,"" said this candid dramatist, “ who is that whawha actor ?""

In the year 1755, Garrick expended large sums of money in preparing a grand spectacle, called “The Chinese Festival,” on a most magnificent scale. It was represented for three nights, to the most tumultuous disapprobation, on the last of which, the benches were torn up, the actors driven from the stage, and the scenery was destroyed. Thus far Davies and Murphy have noticed the subject, but the following anecdote has not been related. Some nights after this transaction, Garrick appeared in the part of Archer, and was imperiously called upon to beg pardon of the audience. His indignation was aroused by this injustice; he had suffered a pecuniary loss to an immense amount, and undergone the heaviest inflictions of outrage for an act of tasteful splendour. “Smarting,"" therefore, “ with his wounds, being gallid to be so pester'd,” he came resolutely forward, and having stated the injury his fortune had sustained, assured them he was above want, superior to insult, and unless permitted to discharge his duty to the best of his abilities, would never-never appear upon the stage again. The audience was struck with the firmness and propriety of his appeal, and by an instantaneous burst of applause, bore a strong testimony against the riotors in favour of this spirited manager. HISSING In 1772, the king of Denmark prohibited hissing in the Copenhagen theatres, or any equivalent marks of disapprobation. This despotic order was occasioned by a riot at one of the houses, which arose from an author having exposed a critic upon the stage, who had treated his works with uncommon severity.  182 ANECDOTES, The Village Lawyer-Portrait of Garrick-Fielding-Madame Mara.

These people were at ﬁrst informed that they were to be burned to death at the stake. Afterwards it was decided that they should be given their lives and freedom if they  SHAKESPEARE IN THE FOREST 179 would entertain their captors with an exhibition of their art that very evening. This contract stipulated that the performance should be as complete and detailed as though given before a white audience, and that any member of the company failing to act his part in a satisfactory manner would render himself liable to become a target for bullets and arrows. Under the circumstances it is doubtful if a play was ever presented under more extraordinary conditions, greater difficulties, or by actors more anxious to perform creditably their respective parts, than was this one given in the depths of a Florida wilderness. The stage was an open space, roofed by arching trees, and lighted by great ﬁres of pine knots constantly replenished. The wings were two wagons drawn up on either side. The play selected for this important occasion was Hamlet, and for awhile everything proceeded smoothly. Then the audience began to grow impatient of the long soliloquies, and to the intense surprise of the captives, a gruff voice called out : “Oh, cut it short an’ git to ﬁghtin’l ” “No, give us a dance,” shouted another, “ an’ hyar’s a chune to dance by.” With this a pistol shot rang out, and a ball struck the ground close to Horatio’s feet.

Aunt Frances—I used to call her so, though she was no actual relation of my H  114 TALES AND POEMS. mother's—was very poorly the next day, and poor Milly was quite feverish and low; but yet she would not obey the doctor's directions to stay in bed after the second day, but would come down stairs in the parlour (I had taken private rooms for the party) and talk to me. Oh, how I drank in the music of her voice! How I listened, and looked, and loved ! I knew she was grateful to me for saving her life, she said—though I don't know that I did that exactly-and I felt that she was mistaking that sentiment for love; and she thought then that she might some day, that she did then, return my affection. “She was so kind and gentle to me in those days, and never was slave more willing than I to wait upon her and obey her behests. It was one long golden dream. I knew it could not last. I knew the spell would be broken soon.

Is it a secret? Not now. Here he comes!” Sir George may, perhaps, have heard these last words, as he ascended the terrace steps. Whether he heard them or not, he could scarce fail to mark his wife’s excited gestures —— her brightened eyes — her raised colour — and the sudden check in the conversation, caused by his own arrival. Again that dull pain seemed to gnaw at his heart, when he thought how bright, and eager, and amused she always seemed in Florian’s company. He had seen the two on the terrace as he rode home across the park, and joined them by the shortest way from the stable, without a tinge of that suspicion he might not he wanted, which was so painful now. Still he kept down all such unworthy feelings as he would have trampled an adder under his heavy ridingboots. “Bring me a. rose, Cerise,” he said, cheerily, as he passed his wife. “There are not many of them left now. Here, Florian,” he added, tossing him a  run “uammon Arms.” 173 packet he held in his hand. “A note from pretty Alice at the ‘Hamilton Arms.’ Have a care, man! there are a host of rivals in the field.” Florian looked at the writing on the cover, and turned pale: This might easily be accounted for, but why should Cerise, at the same instant, have blushed so red ——- redder even than the rose she was plucking for her husband? Perhaps that was the question Sir George asked himself as he walked moodily into the house to dress. CHAPTER XVII. The “Hamilton Arms.” LIKE many old country places of the time, Hamilton Hill had a village belonging to it, which seemed to have nestled itself into the valley under shelter of the great house, just near enough to reap the beneﬁts of so august a neighbourhood, but at such a distance as not to infringe on the sacred precincts of the deer-park, or on the romantic privacy of the pleasure grounds. Where there is a village there will be thirst, and thirst seems to be an Englishman’s peculiar care and privilege; therefore, instead of sla-king and quenching it at once by the use of water, he cherishes and keeps it alive, so to speak, with the judicious application of beer. A public-house is, accordingly, as necessary an adjunct to an English hamlet as an oven to a cook-shop, a copper to a laundry, or a powder-magazine to a privateer.  174 . . cnmsu. . .The village of Nether-Hamilton possessed, then, one of these indispensable appendages; but, fortunately for the landlady, its inhabitants were obliged to ascend a.

An unexpected disappointment awaited me. My Eloenes of Modern Prison Life had not sold so well as Novels and Tales. I. 12  178 ' A noeun’s LIFE. had been anticipated, and my publisher was gruﬁiy disinclined to speculate in any future works done in the same style. During the time of my imprisonment, a new caricaturist had started, with a manner of his own; he had already formed a new school, and the ﬁckle public were all running together after him and his disciples. I looked at his works and theirs; and, vain as I was, my practical common sense told me that my occupation as a caricaturist was gone. The new men had cast down broad farce under their feet, and had set up genteel comedy instead. I felt that I might feebly imitate, but that I could never successfully rival them; and I said to myself: “This scene in the drama of your life, my friend, has closed in; you must enter on another, or drop the curtain at once.” Of course I entered on another. I went to call on an artist-friend of my free-and-easy days. I had heard it darkly whispered that he was something of a vagabond. But the term is so loosely applied, and it seems so diﬁicult, after all, to deﬁne what a vagabond is, or to strike the right moral balance between the vagabond work which is boldly published, and the vagabond work which is reserved for private circulation only, that I did not feel justiﬁed in holding aloof from my former friend; especially as I expected him, so far as advice went, to be of some assistance to me. Accordingly, I renewed our acquaintance, and told him my present diﬁiculty. He was a sharp man, and he showed me a way out of it directly. “You have a good eye for a likeness,” he said; “and you have made it keep you hitherto. Very well. Make it keep you still. You can’t proﬁtably caricature people’s faces any longer—never mind! go to the other extreme, and ﬂatter them now. Turn portrait-painter.

Before I got to the shop, I met Mr.Batterbury, doing his four miles an hour.

She said that, on the evening of the ﬁfteenth of August Madame de la Pivardiére sent everybody out of the way, even her little daughter, whom she sent to sleep in the garret, locking her in. There remained in the house only Madame de la Pivardiére, herself and Catherine Lemoins, the other servant; but the Prior of Miseray was in the court-yard along with two of his valets, one of whom was armed with a sabre, the other with a pistol. Apparently, Madame de la Pivardiére had not full conﬁdence in Catherine Lemoins, for she sent her out to get some eggs from a farm-house at a short distance. She then went out to the prior and his servants, and brought them into the house. A candle having been lighted, they all proceeded to the room where M. de la Pivardiére was sleeping. One of the men drew aside the curtains of the bed and, seeing that their victim was lying in a position which rendered it diﬂicult to strike him, the man mounted on a stool and ﬁred down upon him. The unfortunate  THE FBENCHMAN OF TWO WIVES. gentleman was only wounded, and, starting up streaming with blood, begged his life in the most moving tones, addressing himself especially to his wife without being able to touch her compassion. The other servant of the prior fell upon him with his sword and wounded him in several places. She, the witness, struck with horror at the spectacle and at the terrible cries of her master, could not refrain from tears, but was threatened by her mistress with the same fate if she showed any compassion. She also deposed that, as soon as her master was dead, the prior’s servants took away the body, and she did not know what they did with it; but whilst they were gone Madame de la Pivardiére fetched some ashes and herself scoured the boards. She had the bed carried into the cellar, along with the bed-clothes, which were steeped in blood. The straw was taken out of the mattrass and burned, and the ticking ﬁlled with some fresh half-beaten straw. The prior’s servants returned in about two hours, and they all sat down to supper together. At ﬁrst, this witness said that the prior himself was not actually present during the assassination. But, shortly afterwards falling dangerously ill, and being apparently at the point of death, she sent for the judges and declared to them that she had disguised the truth as regarded the Prior of Miseray, and that he was the man who actually struck the fatal blow. Catherine Lemoins, the other servant, conﬁrmed the evidence, and added that on her return from fetching the eggs, she went straight to the room occupied by the Sieur de la Pivardiére and found him just dead; that she desired the two valets to take away the body and bury it,

My heart misgave me; and in these signs I thought I discerned the sad forerunners of his old malady. I watched him closely, without seeming to do so. We all tried to engage him in cheerful conversation,‘ and to win him back to some of the interests of everyday _ life. He repulsed our proffered sympathy, gently but ﬁrmly; replied in monosyllables, and retreated into solitude as quickly as possible. It was a continual heartache to us to see one whom we loved so well thus build up of his own free will a barrier between us. He would stay out till late at night, pacing to and fro on the garden terrace, musing, and muttering sadly to himself. My bedroom window looked on this terrace. On going to bed one night I found the window open, and approach 160 ova FAMILY rrcrunn. ing to shut it, heard Neville walking backwards and forwards beneath it. I looked out, and could just distinguish his tall gaunt ﬁgure. He was muttering to himself, and tossing his arms wildly as he walked. “Disgraced! disgraced!” he exclaimed despairingly as he approached. “Can I see her thus? Can I ask her to love me, to comfort me, to be my wife? Ah, me! I see no light, no way out of this dreary valley. But I will go to-morrow! This torture is killing me! I will see her, and know the truth — I will tell her —” Here his voice died to a whisper in the distance. I closed my window gently, and prayed heaven to comfort this unhappy soul. The words I had overheard struck cold to my heart. Scant comfort would he ﬁnd where he looked for it most: that I knew. What was the fascination that drew two strong men to the side of this girl? And how would such rivalry end? Vain questions which Time, the great solver of riddles, alone could answer. He dressed himself more carefully than usual the following morning; and, at an early hour in the forenoon, left home for Doctor Graile’s. He did not retur n till _ after dark, and going directly up-stairs, without seeing any one, locked himself in his own room. We all retired at the usual time.

His slaves usually numbered between four hundred and fifty     1 68 A ZIGZAG JOURNEY IN THE SUNNY SOUTH.     and five hundred, who were like so many children in having to be clothed, fed,   doctored, housed, and directed by their master.     Under Mrs. Washington's own eye all their clothes were cut and made ; and   if sickness broke out in one of the quarters, it was the General himself who   commonly visited and prescribed for them, often giving them their medicine   with his own hands.

Libbie   went back and closed the book, with a word of explanation to   Margaret Hall, and then ran downstairs to learn the reason of   Anne's anxiety to see her.     "" Oh, Libbie ! "" she burst out with, and then, checking herself   with the remembrance of Libbie's last solemn duty, ""how's Margaret   Hall ? But, of course, poor thing, she'll fret a bit at first ; she'll be   some time coming round, mother says, seeing it's as well that poor   lad is taken ; for he'd always ha' been a cripple, and a trouble to   her — he was a fine lad once, too.""     She had come full of another and a diflFerent subject ; but the   sight of Libbie's sad, weeping face, and the quiet, subdued tone of   her manner, made her feel it awkward to begin on any other theme   than the one which filled her companion's mind. To her last speech   Libbie answered sorrowfully :     "" No doubt, Anne, it's ordered for the best ; but oh ! don't call   him, don't think he could ever ha' been, a trouble to his mother,   though he were a cripple. She loved him all the more for each   thing she had to do for him — I am sure I did."" Libbie cried a little   behind her apron. Anne Dixon felt stiU more awkward in introducing the discordant subject.     ""Well! 'flesh is grass,' Bible says;"" and, having fulfilled the   etiquette of quoting a text, if possible, if not of making a moral   observation on the fleeting nature of earthly things, she thought she   was at liborty to pass on to her real errand.

The state labored   under this disability in realizing upon its chief product   for many years, both in the wheat, and the flour made   from it. Many mills were erected at the Falls of St. Anthony, with a very great output of fiour, which, with the   lumber manufactured at that point, composed the chief   export of the state. The process of grinding wheat was   the old style, of an upper and nether millstone, which   left the flour of darker color, less nutritious, and less desirable than that from the winter wheat made in the same   way. About the year 1871 it was discovered that a new   process of manufacturing flour was in operation on the   Danube and at Budapest. Mr. George H. Christian, a   partner of Gov. C. C. Washburn in the milling business   at Minneapolis, studied the invention, which consisted of   crushing the wheat by means of rollers made of steel and   porcelain, instead of grinding it, as of old, to which the   French had added a new process of eliminating the bran   specs from the crushed product, by means of a flat oscillating screen or bolt with an upward blast of air through   it, upon which the crushed product was placed and   cleansed of all bran impurities. In 1871 Gen. C. C.   Washburn and Mr. Christian introduced this French invention into their mills in Minneapolis, and derived from   it great advantage in the appearance and value of their   flour. This was called a ""middlings purifier."" In 1874   they introduced the roller crushing process, and the result was, that the hard spring wheat returned a flour superior to the product of the winter wheat, and placed   Minnesota upon more than an equality with the best   flour-producing states in the Union. This process has   been universally adopted throughout the United States   in all milling localities, with great advantage to that industry.

Eestitution was partially made in a peculiarly   Merry Monarch vein ; but the breach of faith was irreparable,   the ghost of a national bank had been laid.     The government of the Prince of Orange sadly wanted   confidence in his sohdity of attachment to his new country   to be spread, and William fretted under the same need of   money to war against France.     His creature Michael Godfrey, and favourite Bishop,   Burnet, assisted by William Paterson, a brother Scot, drew   up a national bank conception which met the royal sanction.   Burnet had studied the Dutch bank system in working on   the spot. Paterson knew a httle of everything.     He was a Dugald Dalgetty, as much of an arithmetician as   Cassio, with a spice of the devil in Fernando Cortez. Like all   needy wits, he could toss millions about with a confidence of     70 THE FOUNDER OF THE BANK.     catching them which he would not have shown in haggling,   with a crown in his pocket for a new sword-tag. Montague   (afterwards Lord Halifax), appreciated Paterson's ardent   spirit and fervent imagination. Besides, anything but direct   taxation which would also procure immediate funds, was   acceptable beforehand. Burnet patronised the Dumfries   man because he had been originally trained for the church.     The king and cabinet being eager, Parliament was most   dexterously kneaded, for the leaven of land holders were   hostile. By tacking the Bank Act to the tail of one   concerning a raising of supplies, the mighty germ of an   institution, apparently indisseverable from the crown and   constitution, was smuggled through the legislative body.   The royal signature was affixed 27th July, 1694. In return   for the privileges £1,200,000 was lent at 8 per cent.     The programme was thus couched : — It will rescue the   government from extortioners, raise fund value, lower interest,   revive public credit, extend the circulation, improve commerce, facilitate the annual supplies, and connect the people   with its rulers.     On the other hand, able voices, and many, accused it as a   monopoly which would engross all the money, tempt it out   of trade, enable brokers and the like to prey, encourage   frauds and commercial gambhng, corrupt national morals,   and be used for arbitrary purposes of the worst description.     The Bank received leave to discount with bills to bearer,   their emission not to surpass the amount loaned to the State.   4 per cent, was the charge for management ;

THE SWISS PEASANT. 191     From that night Fanny became a constant inmate of the   chateau.     It was Madame de Marville's project to give her a   bourgeois education, which would raise her from the   hardships of a peasant's life, and yet not elevate her   above her natural position in society. She was brought   up kindly, but humbly ; it was the virtues of her disposition which raised her in the eyes of all around her —   not any ill-judged favour of her benefactress. The night   of the destruction of her family never passed away from   her memory ; it set a seal of untimely seriousness on her   childish brow, awoke deep thoughts in her infant heart,   and a strong resolve that while she lived, her beloved   friends should find her, as far as her humble powers   admitted, a source of good alone — a reason to rejoice that   they had saved her frotu the destruction that had overwhelmed her family.     Thus Fanny grew up in beauty and in virtue. Her   Bmiles were as the rainbows of her native torrents : her   voice, her caresses, her light step, her unalterable sweetness and ceaseless devotion to the wishes of others, made   hei the idol of the family. Henry, the only child of her   protectors, was of her own age, or but a few months her   senior. Every time Henry returned from school to visit   his parents, he found Fanny more beautiful, more kind,   more attractive than before ; and the first passion his   youthful heart knew was for the lovely peasant girl,   whose virtues sanctified his home. A look, a gesture   betrayed his secret to his mother; she turned a hasty   glance on Fanny, and saw on her countenance innocence   and confidence alone. Half reassured, yet stiU fearful,   Madame de Marville began to reflect on some cure for   the threatened evil. She could not bear to send away   Fanny; she was solicitous that her son should for the   present reside in his home. The lovely girl was perfectly unconscious of the sentiments of the young     192 MARY W.

From the moment when, on the stormy night, the   tones of the wife, whom he knows to be far distant, float   weirdly to Wieland up the wooded slope, our attention is   held and bewildered. The soft voice which thrills in on   Clara through the thunderous twilight, — which breathed at   her pillow at midnight, — which shrieked at her very ear as   she was making her way up the dark staircase, touches us   with the same horror that enveloped the haunted girl. The   face revealed to her in the flash of the lamp as she turns   wildly, ""every muscle tense, forehead and brow drawn into   vehement expression, lips stretched as in the act of shrieking, eyes emitting sparks,"" out-terrorizes a whole phalanx   of ghosts. An indescribably weird efifect is imparted to the   scene by the words, ""The sound and the vision were present   and departed at the same instant, but the cry was blown into   my very ears while the face was many paces distant !"" Edgar   Huntly, with its somnambulism, is not equally successful.   The first appearance of the sleep-walker is somewhat impressive. But this auspicious opening is a promise unfulfilled. Clithero's history and remorse are too absurd, and   after that the whole book resolves itself into a tale of Indian   adventure, which, indeed, in its prophecy of Cooper, is the   most interesting part of the story.     Arthur Mervyn, a story of the Yellow Fever Plague of   1798 in New York, gives ample scope for the growing interest in physical horrors which, as we have seen, is a characteristic of the School of Terror. Though Brown certainly   dwells far too much on this physical horror for its own sake,   he is yet eminently skilful, also, in using it justifiably for the   artistic enhancement of higher sensations. One striking   instance of his power in such combination is that in which   the apparition appears to Arthur as he stands alone in the   desolate chambers of a fever-smitten house from which all   the inhabitants have been removed for burial. ""The door   opened,"" it reads, ""and a figure glided in. The portmanteau   dropped from my hands, and my heart's blood was chilled.   If an apparition of the dead were possible, and that possibility   I could not deny, this was such an apparition.

It happened that   a part of the Borysthenes in the neighbourhood of the Princess   Flibustikopfkoi's estate overflowed, and the Parisian public came   forward as sympathisers, as they did for sufiering Ireland and   Prince O'Connell the other day. A great fete was resolved on, and   Madame de Paturot became one of the ladies patronesses.     And at this/efe we are presented to a great character, in whom   the hahitui of Paris will perhaps recognise a certain likeness to   a certain celebrity of the present day, by name Monsieur Hector   Berlioz, the musician and critic.     "" The great artist promised his assistance. All the wind   instruments in Paris were engaged in advance, and all the brass   bands, and all the fiddles possible.     "" ' Princess,' said the artist, agitating his locks, ' for your sake   I would find the hymn of the creation that has been lost since the   days of the deluge.'     "" The day of the festival arrived. The artist would allow none   but himself to conduct his own chef-d'oeuvre ; he took his place at   a desk five metres above the level of the waves of the orchestra,   and around him were placed the most hairy and romantic musicians   of the day, who were judged worthy of applauding at the proper   place. The artist himself, the utterer of the musical apocalypse,   cast his eyes over the assembly, seeking to dominate the multitude   by that glance, and also to keep in order a refractory lock of   hair which would insist upon interrupting it. I had more than   once heard of the plan of this great genius, which consists in setting public and private life to music. A thousand extraordinary     JEROME PATUROT 395     anecdotes are recorded of the extraordinary power which he   possessed for so doing; among others is the story of the circumstance which occurred to him in a tavern. Having a wish for a   dish of fricandeau and sorrel, the genius took a flageolet out of his   pocket, and modulated a few notes.     ' Tum-tiddle-di-tum-tiddle-de,' &o.     The waiter knew at once what was meant, and brought the fricandeau and the sauce required. Genius always overcomes its detractors   in this way.

He mufst be desperate, indeed, before he resorts to that   other alternative which he hissed in my ear on the heights   of Hadsem.""     James Billings habitually slept but little, and that little   at whatever time proved most convenient. He rarely dismissed any of the many problems which, at different periods, thronged his busy brain, before he had worked out a   satisfactory solution. It was his habit, always before seeking repose, to think over any conversation of interest in   which he had been engaged, and to calculate how far he   had succeeded in making the impression he desired. At   such times his thoughts almost invariably took the form of   words, and he appeared to derive increased self-satisfaction   from the sound of his own voice. On the present occasion   he drew pff his boots, incased his feet in a pair of morocco   slippers, lighted a fragrant Havana, and settled himself   comfortably down to think aloud.     ""For a man of sense,"" so ran his thoughts, ""for a man   of sense, and very few troublesome scruples, Hamilton was   startled more than could have been expected when I hinted   at the indispensable necessity of putting George Washington out of the way when our plans were ripe, or nearly so.

'     The police troopers and foot constables, who are always   instructed in infantry drill at an early stage of their career,   immediately stepped out after the immovable British fashion,   making as if they were about to advance in the very teeth of   the aroused multitude. Merlin himself, on his grey Arab, rode   on at their head as though he had the command of something   like an equal force. We could hear him say, ' Steady, men,   mark time ! ' as the little band executed their manceuvre with   most creditable precision.     The Commissioner, with his usual expression of half humorous gravity, loungingly sat on his well-known horse, close   to whose feet his greyhounds crowded, looking wistfully at the   multitude as if, with the fine instinct of their species, they had   divined that a storm was imminent.     So invariably accustomed were the greater portion of the   people to render implicit submission to the law as represented   by the personages now present, that even when their absurd   inadequacy as combatants was so sharply contrasted, a curious   feeling of schoolboy shamefacedness and moral inferiority was   uppermost for the moment. Then the reactionary element   prevailed, and with a mingled sentiment of admiration for the   dauntless front of the small army of regulars and a half painful   derision of their own instinctive deference, a storm of cheers   burst from the multitude, which was taken up again and again,   till the forest rang to its mountain buttresses.

THE birth of a daughter is a disappointment in   the south, as in other parts of India. The   chief element of distress with the Tamils is the prospect of care and expense in connection with marriage.

Yet the saying   is attributed to her that ignorance is the ornament of   women.^ In later centuries there has been no general   education of females. At the time when Christians   entered the country, the few girls sent to native   schools were those intended to serve in temples, and   no system prevailed of private literary instruction.   The power to read and write was considered dangerous   for women to possess. The successes of missionary   teachers have wonderfully modified this opinion ; and   now, where formerly presents and promises were   necessary to secure even a low-caste girl as a pupil, girls   of all classes are presented as candidates for education.     The little book next translated, the Garland of   Advice for Women, is a proof that in late years the   Tamil people have not been wholly indifferent to the   ' Conday-venthan, line 66.

The work appears   to be of modern composition, and may have originated   in a purpose to counteract the teaching of Christians.   It is a purely Gentile production, commending Ouvay's   maxims to observance, and the example of Valluvar's   wife to imitation.^ Evidently it was not intended for   children in training for temple service, since it   inculcates the duties of domestic life.     It may be that its sentences have reached the   minds of girls through the ear chiefly, by dint of singsong repetition ; but that they have acquired them   there is proof abundant.

Just at first, indeed, he tried sophistically to   persuade himself his duty to Christina demanded that he   should go away at once, and never mind the sufferings of a   mere spaniel ; but his better nature told him the next   moment that such sophisms were indefensible, and his   humane instincts overcame even the profound instinct of   self-preservation. He sat down quietly beside the warm   corpse. ' Thank goodness,' he said, with a slight shiver of   disgust, ' I 'm not one of those weak-minded people who are   troubled by remorse. They would be so overcome by terror   at what they had done that they would want to run away   from the body immediately, at any price. But I don't think   I could feel remorse. It is an incident of lower natures —   natures that are capable of doing actions under one set of   impulses, which they regret when another set comes uppermost in turn. That implies a want of balance, an imperfect   co-oi-dination of parts and passions. The perfect character   is consistent with itself; shame and repentance are confessions of weakness. For my part, I never do anything   without having first deliberately decided that it is the best   or the only thing to do ; and having so done it, I do not   draw back like a girl from the necessary consequences of my   own act. No fluttering or running away for me. Still, I   must admit that all that blood does look very ghastly.   Poor old gentleman !

In the midst of their hustle, the poor stage-coachman, who had waited with uncommon patience in the hope that Alderman Holloway would at last recollect him, pressed forward, and petitioned to be paid his five guineas for the lost parcel.—"" I have lost my place already,"" said he, ""and the little goods I have will be seized this day, for the value of that unlucky parcel, master."" The alderman put his hand slowly into his purse; but just when he had pulled out five guineas, a servant came into the room, to inform Dr. B. that a sailor was waiting in the hall, who desired to speak, directly, about something of consequence, to the stage-coachman.

Some were open on all sides ; others only in front, or at one end. Some of these dwellings were more than twenty feet in length, and most of them about twelve feet in breadth. Grass hammocks, in which the Indians always sleep, were suspended from the rafters, in which a few of the old men and some of the women who were sick, were lying; and between the rafters and the thatch were collections of all kinds of valuables ; bows and arrows, fish spears, canoe paddles, guns, nets, cassareep jars, cooking utensils, cassada bread, dried meat, and a variety of other articles, were all stored together. In the spaces between the dwellings fires had been kindled in round holes in the ground, where large black earthen pots, swung from a triangle of three sticks, were simmering, watched by nearly

Little Simpleton did not eat the apple, but sat down in a corner and cried,“Roll, roll, little apple on the silver plate, and show me towns and fields, forests and seas, lofty mountains and beautiful skies.” And the apple began to roll on the plate, and there appeared on it town after town; ships sailing on the seas, and people in the fields; mountains and beautiful skies ; suns and stars. All these things looked so beautiful, and were so wonderful, that it would be impossible to tell of them in a story, or describe them with the pen. At first the elder sisters looked at the little plate with delight; soon, however, their hearts were filled with envy, and they began to try to get it from their younger sister. But the girl would not part with it on any account. Then the wicked girls said, “Dearest sister, let us go into the forest to gather blackberries."" Little Simpleton got up, gave the plate and apple to her father, and went with them into the forest. They walked about and gathered blackberries. All at once they saw a spade lying upon the ground. The wicked sisters killed Little Simpleton with it, and buried her under a birch-tree.  Story of Little Simpleton. 173 They returned home late, and told their father,—“The Simpleton is lost; she ran away from us in the forest; we searched, but could not find her anywhere. The wolves must have eaten her.” The peasant regretted the loss of his daughter bitterly; for although so simple she was still his child. The wicked sisters also shed tears. Her father put the little silver plate and the little apple into a box, and locked them up. Next morning a shepherd was tending his sheep near the place, playing on his pipe, and searching in the forest for one of his flock that was missing. He observed the little grave under the birch-tree; it was covered by the most lovely flowers, and out of the middle of the grave there grew a reed. The shepherd cut off the reed, and made a pipe of it. As soon as the pipe was prepared, oh, wonderful! it began to play of itself, and say,“Play, oh pipe, play! and comfort my poor parents and sisters. I was killed for the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple.” When the people heard of this they ran out of their huts, and all came round the shepherd and began to ask him who was killed. “Good people,” answered the shepherd, “I don't know who it is.

He at once determined to send this erratic orphan sister to that admirable academy for young ladies kept by Dr. Marks, at Columbia ; and when he told Musidora of his plans, she could scarce contain herself with joy at the prospect of getting away from a home that had not a single association in her mind except that of sorrow. Her brother went to Coosahatchie and purchased the necessary clothing, and the now hopeful girl sat up half the night, and got up at dawn to sew, in order to complete her wardrobe at the earliest possible moment. But a heart-rending disappointment awaited her again; for as soon as her trunks were all ready, her brother walked into her room, and told her he had changed his mind, for the estate could not afford several hundred dollars a year to keep her at Dr. Marks's.  286 THE BLACK GAUNTLET. Musidora actually screamed with disappointment, but she had no power to reverse this cruel decree, and therefore shut herself up in her room for three days, so sunk in despair that the thought flashed through her mind several times to run into the river and drown herself; but the mystic consciousness that her dead mother's spirit was always around her, eventually soothed her troubled spirit, and she would say to herself, surely I shall not always be so miserable, so hopeless, and so unnoticed. About a week after this final determination of Halcombe's, that he was not prepared to make any sacrifices to educate this heart-broken orphan sister, Mrs. Wyndham came to her chamber, where she found her still sobbing with disappointment, and remarked, “Now, Musidora, as you are not going to Columbia, you will not need so many clothes."" She then opened the afflicted child's trunks, and took out whatever she fancied for herself and Britannia. Musidora had had no especial wardrobe since her father's reverses of fortune, but had been supplied from her step-mother's and Britannia's old dresses, altered to fit her; so that she was very proud when everything had been bought new for her to go to Columbia. She protested passionately, therefore, against having her wardrobe, which she had worked so hard to make up, portioned off in this heartless manner. But all the family roared with laughter at what they called her high-mettled spirit and covetous stinginess; and they again asserted that she was the very worst-tempered child in the world. Halcombe Wyndham was a man without genius, but  THE BLACK GAUNTLET. 287 he possessed great business tact. He was therefore enabled to settle up all his father's debts, and yet secure a competence for his family.

Asking farther, they learned that a shattered boat they saw on the beach was one of a pair of boats which had been carried too far out to sea, and had come near an islet which the sailors called Isla de la Man Satanaxio, or The Island of Satan's Hand. It appeared that in that region there was an islet so called, always surrounded by chilly mists and water of a deadly cold; that no one had ever reached it, as it constantly changed place; but that a demon hand sometimes uprose from it,   “ A demon hand sometimes uprose from the islet and plucked away men and even whole boats, which, when once grasped, usually by night, were never seen again, but perished helplessly."" – p. 139   The Isle of Satan's Hand 139 and plucked away men and even whole boats, which, when once grasped, usually by night, were never seen again, but perished helplessly, victims of Satan's Hand.

Not alarmed at the name of Satan, as being that of one whom they had supposed, in their days of darkness, to be their patron, they pushed boldly out to sea and steered westward, a boat-load of Spanish fishermen following in their wake. Passing island after island of green and fertile look, they found themselves at last in what seemed a less favored zone — as windy as the “roaring forties,” and growing chillier every hour.

He, and two of his officers named Lindsay, accepted an invitation to dinner from Maclan himself, for the following day, on which they had determined he should never see the sun rise. To complete the sum of treachery, Glenlyon played at cards, in his own quarters, with the sons of Maclan, John and Alaster, both of whom were also destined for slaughter. About four o'clock in the morning of 13 th February the scene of blood began. A party, commanded by one of the Lindsays, came to Maclan's house and knocked for admittance, which was at once given.

Alarmed with what had been thus observed and heard, the young men hastened to Glenlyon's quarters, where they found that officer and his men preparing their arms. On questioning him about these suspicious appearances, Glenlyon accounted for them by a story that he was bound on an expedition against some of Glengarry's men; and, alluding to the circumstance of their alliance, which made his own cruelty more detestable, he added, "" If anything evil had been intended, would I not have told Alaster and my niece?""

They would be so overcome by terror at what they had done that they would want to run away from the body immediately, at any price. But I don't think I could feel remorse. It is an incident of lower natures— natures that are capable of doing actions under one set of impulses, which they regret when another set comes uppermost in turn. That implies a want of balance, an imperfect co-ordination of parts and passions. The perfect character is consistent with itself; shame and repentance are confessions of weakness. For my part, I never do anything without having first deliberately decided that it is the best or the only thing to do; and having so done it, I do not draw back like a girl from the necessary consequences of my own act.

It was Maister Calmsough of Clauchaneasy that was putting the question, and rendering the meaning into his own sense as he went along. But he chanced upon James Todd of Todston, a well-learned boy; and, if I may say so, a favourite of mine, with whom I had been at great pains that he should  200 BOG-MYRTLE AND PEAT. grow up in the faith and wholesome discipline. Thereto I had fed him upon precious Thomas Boston of Ettrick and the works of godly Mr. Erskine, desiring with great desire that one day he might, by my learning and the blessing of Almighty God, even come to wag his head in a pulpit—a thing which, because of the sins of a hot youth, it had never been in my power, though much in my heart, to do. But concerning the examination. Mr. Calmsough was insisting upon the general mercy of God—which, to my thinking, is at the best a dangerous doctrine, and one that a judicious preacher had best keep his thumb upon. At last he asked Jamie Todd what he thought of the matter; for he was an easy examiner, and would put a question a yard long to be answered with “Yes” and “No”—a fool way of examining, which to me was clear proof of his incapacity. But James Todd was well learned and withstood him, so that Mr. Calmsough grew angry and roared like a bull. I could only sit quiet in my desk, for upon that day it was not within my right to open my mouth in my own school, since it was in the hands of the Presbytery. So I sat still, resting my confidence upon the Lord and the ready answers of James Todd. And I was not deceived.

Many people must have wondered what could have been the origin of the saying in reference to a very small place that “there was not room to swing a cat in it.” “But I don't want to swing a cat in it,” was the very natural rejoinder of a well-known American litterateur to this remark applied to his house. It is possible that we may find the origin of this odd saying in a superstition current in Transylvania, whither it in all probability was carried by the gypsies, whose specialty it is to bear the seeds of superstitions about here and there as the winds do those of plants. In this country it is said that if a cat runs away, when recovered she must be swung three times round to attach her to the dwelling.

Truly this seems a strange way to induce an attachment-or pour encourager les autres.

It is a pity that this saying and faith were unknown to MoncriefMARADAN, “ the Historiogriffe of Cats,” (“Euvres,” Paris, 1794), who would assuredly have made the most of it. As regards entering new houses in Transylvania the rule is not “Devil take the hindmost,” but the foremost. The first person or being who enters the maiden mansion must die, therefore it is safe to throw in a preliminary dog or cat. The scape-cat is, however, to be preferred. I can remember once, when about six years of age, looking down into a well in Massachusetts and being told that the reflection which I saw was the face of a little boy who lived there. This made a deep impression on me, and I reflected that it was very remarkable that the dweller in the well could assume the appearance"

A naked maid standing on a “congenial dung-hill” with a piece of Christmas cake in her mouth would be a subject for an artist which should be eagerly seized in these days when “excuses for the nude in art” are becoming so rare. It is worth observing that this conjuration is very much like one observed in Tuscany, in which Saint Anthony is invoked to manifest by a dog's barking at night, as by other sounds, whether the applicant, or invoker, shall obtain her desire.

The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their property, now took possession of the robbers' minds. They seated themselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, and ordered them to dance  Pride goeth before a Fall 133 to them before returning home. The merchants now mourned their fate. They had lost all they had, except their loin-cloth, and still the robbers were not satisfied, but ordered them to dance. There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever. He pondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, the dance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in which the three robbers had seated themselves on the grass. At the same time he observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, in the assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were now commencing to dance. So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a song is always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keep time with hands and feet, he thus began to sing: ""We are enty men, They are erith men: If each erith man, Surround eno men Eno man remains. Tli, tai, torn, tadingana."" The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was merely singing a song as usual. So it was in one sense; for the leader commenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before he and his companions commenced to approach the robbers. They had understood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade. When two traders discuss the price of an article in  134 Indian Fairy Tales the presence of a purchaser, they use a riddling sort of language. ""What is the price of this cloth?"" one trader will ask another. ""Enty rupees,"" another will reply, meaning "" ten rupees. Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant unless he be acquainted with trade language. By the rules of this secret language erith means "" three,"" enty means "" ten,"" and eno means ""one."" So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-traders that they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pounced upon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while the remaining one bound the robbers' hands and feet. The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understandingthe meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were proudly seated chewing betel and tobacco. Meanwhile the song was sung a third time. Td tai torn had left the lips of the singer ; and, before tadingana was out of them, the traders separated into parties of three, and each party pounced upon a thief. The remaining oneis "" three,"" enty means "" ten,"" ana toDacco r  Pride goeth before a Fall 135 the leader himself—tore up into long narrow strips a large"

Fair Alice herself, far off in her humble home among the downs, need not have grudged the elder woman an hour of her young seaman's society, although every minute of it seemed so strangely prized by this wild, energetic, and mysterious person, with her swarthy face, her scarlet head-dress, and her flashing eyes, gleaming with the fierce anxious tenderness of a leopardess separated from her whelps. Slap-Jack's sea legs had hardly time to become fatigued, ere  226 Cerise. at a turn in the mountain-path he found Célandine waiting for him, and somewhat to his disgust, peering about in every direction, as if loth to be observed ; a clandestine interpretation of their harmless meeting which roused the young seaman's ire, and against which he would have vehemently protested, had she not placed her hand over his mouth and implored him urgently, though in a whisper, to keep silence. Then she bade him follow, still below her breath, and so preceded him up the steep ascent with cautious, stealthy steps, but at a pace that made the foretop-man's unaccustomed knees shake and his breath come quick. The sun was hot, the mountain high, the path overgrown with cactus and other prickly plants, tangled with creepers and not devoid of snakes. Monkeys chattered, parrots screamed, glittering insects quivered like tinsel in the sun, or darted like flashes of coloured light across the forest-shade. Vistas of beauty, such as he had never dreamed of, opened out on either side, and looking back more than once to take breath while he ascended, the deep blue sea lay spread out beneath him, rising broader and broader to meet the blue transparent sky. But Slap-Jack, truth to tell, was sadly indifferent to it all. Uneasiness of the legs sadly counteracted pleasure of the eye. It was with considerable gratification that he observed his leader diverge from the upward path, and rounding the shoulder of the hill, take a direction somewhat on the downward slope. Then he wiped his brows, with a sigh of relief, and asked audibly enough for something to drink. She seemed less afraid of observation now, although she did not comply with his request, but pointed downward to a dark hollow, from which ascended a thin, white, spiral line of smoke, the only sign denoting human habitation in the midst of this luxuriant wilderness of tropical growth and fragrance. Then, parting the branches with both hands, she dived into the thicket, to stop at the door of a hut, so artfully concealed amongst the dense luxuriant foliage that a man might have passed within five yards and never known it was there but for the smoke. Célandine closed the door cautiously behind her visitor, handed him a calabash of water, into which she poured some rum from a goodly stone jar-holding at

The phantom, he said, had driven him on to the spot where his enemies lay in wait for him; and when he was flying from them, and looked back to see if they were near, the only figure he discerned was that of the maiden running with her long hair fallen about her, as when in life she ran before him, and pointing a drawn sword at him.

Dut now for thee and me this time of preternatural awakening is wellnigh over. The life in each is but a weak spark of that which glowed in Eberhard and his vassal. In each of us doubtless it lingers for some reasonable purpose, whether one day to be re-united to its ampler source, or to take new shapes, and work for other than human ends in some different region of existence. Of this much be thou sure, that life is more and worthier than its outward agitations and clamours, the sea larger and more stable than its bubbles. There are millions of connected, concentric realities, ever revolving and unfolding themselves, which must each do its own work steadily, not dashing and exploding into the track of its neighbour. All these may, by the nobler intelligences, be studied and understood, if love, and faith, and patience be not wanting. But it is the prerogative of folly to fancy that revolt, display, noise, subjugation can be profitable for anything, and that, when these are impossible, existence stagnates.

The piece of ground on which the house stood, was a small ascent in the bosom of the valley, about half a mile from the plantation just mentioned. In front of it was an avenue cut through the woods to the cleared grounds, which sloping with a gentle descent, opened a prospect of an immense field of Indian corn, which being now about half grown, presented, as the fitful breeze played over it, the appearance of a waving sea of vegetable green. Two streams of crystal water, which ran on the right and left of the house within a hundred yards distance, and were shaded by trees of a larger growth than those around, completed the symmetry of the whole. Exclamations of delight broke from all the party as they beheld this beautiful spot. There were no out-houses, no dirty yards, cowpens or pigstyes,no enclosures of any description, nothing on which the eye of taste might not rest with pleasure, except the sign-post and its appendages—and, loath we are to say it, the portly figure of the host himself. Astonished were the whole party as they beheld him, standing before his door, a huge hill of a man. Enormous as were his dimensions, and unwieldy as appeared his limbs, there was, nevertheless, some little smack of the military in the erect position of his person, and the air of decision which was indicated by his countenance and manner; his three-cornered cock'd hat, and scarlet waistcoat slashed and carbonadoed with tarnished lace, might also induce to the supposition  130 that he had seen service; whilst his long black coat, cut in the fashion of George the second's day, demonstrated of what description that service was—surgeon to a regiment, ay, reader, and a regiment of horse.

I should like to consult with you upstairs about that letter—you know.” They left the Hall—it had kept its privileges as breakfastroom—together; they had been gone ten minutes when Adèle returned. She seemed absorbed in thought; Anna looked at her crossly, but Adèle stood on the hearth gazing at the fire. She did not feel the look. Anna had to take the trouble of speaking. “Why did you not mind what I said last night º’ she asked, sharply; “why did you let them get hold of him * Why did you not know he was gone when they did 2 Well, what ails you ?” For Adèle was blushing and laughing with very mischievous mirth. “Do they know when he is coming back 2"" she asked; “do they know where I am to meet him in an hour?

When we inform the public that they may rely upon the truth of the following story, which tolls a pregnant moral, and points tn the consequences of a vice for which our country (unfortunately) stands preeminent among the nations of the earth, we have, perhaps, done as much for the cause of sobriety as could be effected by the proudest triumph of the moral teacher. The vice of drunkenness is too often reprobated only for its effects on the moral and physical health, and the worldly interests of the unhappy votaries themselves; but there are evils beyond these, which extend their influence far and wide throughout society—dissolving endearing links, entailing misery and death on those who are nearest and dearest to the deluded victims; and only repented of when all is beyond the hope of cure or amendment. Walter Brown and James Maitland had been intimate friends from their boyhood. They had gone through the progressive classes of the grammar school together, and together had completed their education at the university.

Unlike many of the friendships of youth, however, that of Brown and Maitland did not terminate with their educational course; it continued with unalatad warmth and sinoerity after they had entered into the world and begun to share in its perplexities and troubles But of these perplexities and troubles, it must bo confessed, neither of the young men had by any means an undue proportion. Their fathers were both wealthy, and thus was their way smoothed to prosperity. It was about this period—that is, after Brown and Maitland had entered into the world—that I became acquainted with them. It was in the year 18—. This acquaintance soon ripened into a sincere and cordial friepdship. It was impossible it could be otherwise, at least on my part, for they were both excellent young men; highly educated and accomplished; possessed of first rate abilities, amiable in their disposition, and of noble and generous natures; in short, they were altogether two as fine young fellows as the city"

There was a city there then, and it had a romantic name which   CALIFORNIA SCRAP-BOOK. 355 we have now forgotten. But it is all in ruins now, and not a trace of it is left. There had been two or three other little boats up the river, to the different cities, during the winter, but we encountered first the snags of the Sacramento. Colonel Semple had been up the river during the high water of the spring of '50, and located the city of Colusa at a point about seven miles above here. That was our destination. But it took the boat some seven days, with the assistance of innumerable Indians, to reach there. At Mead's we got on a sand-bar, and in backing around we broke the “gearing” of one of the engines, and then the boat had to make the balance of the way up, and all her return trip, with one wheel. Getting tired of so slow a process, and being desirous of seeing the city that was to be so famous, we landed on the east side of the river, and getting an Indian for a guide, we struck out on foot for the city. The Indians then always traveled in a kind of dog-trot, and as soon as we landed, our guide struck it up. We followed in silence for about a quarter of a mile, our guide keeping about twenty or thirty paces in advance of us. We hallooed at him to hold up, but he thought we wanted him to go faster, and he was equal to the task. We were obliged to keep up, for it was the wildest country we had ever seen. Through thick timber and the undergrowth of pea-vine, wild oats, brush, and every imaginable thing, we went, so thick that we wondered that the Indians had ever been able to make a path through it. But we had no time either for observation or reflection. On and on through that dense wood our guide “trotted.” We have a distaste for a “trot” until now. We thought we had trotted over ten miles—and have seen since that it was about four—when our guide stopped. He was opposite the “city,” but there was no path into it. He made signs that we would have to break through the thicket. He was entirely naked, but he took the lead, tearing through brush and briar at a rate perfectly astonishing, but he could not trot—we had him there. We could follow as fast as he could break the road. It was about a half mile from the path to the river, and, although he had  356 CALIFORNIA SCRAP-ISOOK. no clothes whatever, and took the lead, we were scratched four times as much as he. The city afforded no ferry, and our only alternative was to swim. The Indian proposed, by signs, to carry our clothes across on his head; we accepted the

We carried her upstairs, and while the women were putting her to bed, still unconscious, still slightly convulsed, I slipped out, and saddled one of the horses, and rode as fast as the heavy-trotting beast could go, to Hornby, to find the doctor there, and bring him back.

The doctor said so, when he came in the early summer morning. I believe we had come to know the nature of the illness in the night-watches that had gone before. As to hope of ultimate recovery, or even evil prophecy of the probable end, the cautious doctor would be entrapped into neither. He gave his directions, and promised to come again; so soon, that this one thing showed his opinion of the gravity of the case. By God's mercy she recovered, but it was a long, weary time first. According to previously made plans, I was to have gone home at the beginning of August. But all such ideas were put aside now, without a word being spoken. I really think that I was necessary in the house, and especially necessary to the minister at this time; my father was the last man in the world, under such circumstances, to expect me home. I say I think I was necessary in the house. Every person (I had almost said every creature, for all the dumb beasts seemed to know and love Phillis) about the place went grieving and sad, as though a cloud was over the sun. They did their work, each striving to steer clear of the temptation to eye-service, in fulfilment of the trust reposed in them by the minister.

At the same time, the over-hanging smoke lost its density, and extending itself over a large space, communicated a turbid and troubled ap 168 THE ISLAND, pearance to the sky, and rendered the stars wan, and dim, and oscillatory. Austin felt his spirits sink under the influence of the scene, and gladly would have exchanged its depressing solemnity for the tumult and danger of an actual battle with the soldiers of the Inquisition, for which he had made so many apparently unnecessary preparations. After a considerable quantity of earth had been removed, one of the Indians struck with his pickaxe something which returned a hollow sound. A little more labour was the means of uncovering a coffin. The whole party started back upon seeing it, leaned on their working implements, and looked inquiringly towards Austin. He knew that the coffin contained the body of Lamberto, but though he had expected to encounter it, still he shuddered at the sight of it, and striving to conceal his emotion, cried, “This is not what I seek: proceed, proceed.” The Indians obeyed, one of them exclaiming, “Horrible omen —we shall see something worse than this ere we have finished our task.” The excavation of the ground now advanced with greater rapidity than it had done at first,  THE ISLAND. 169 the soil within a few feet of the surface having been found very dry and hard. Austin watched the progress of the workmen with the most intense anxiety, for none of those marks which were mentioned in Herkarl's instructions as indicating the proximity of the treasure, had as yet been discovered by himself; and doubts, fears, and surmises were beginning to arise in his mind, when something like a mound of hardened loam was uncovered. The Indians paused, and then struck it with their pickaxes. It instantly cracked and fell in pieces, and an entire human skeleton rolling out, dropped at the feet of those who had destroyed its earthy tenement. The exhumation of these mortal remains, seemed to Austin to confirm the truth of all that Herkarl had told him, and he now considered himself actually in possession of the treasure, for the skeleton was doubtless that of the slave whom the pirates had sacrificed on the night of its deposition. The Indians again simultaneously suspended their work, and forming a circle, gazed in silence upon the hideous object which lay disinterred before them. Austin was also lost in reflection for some time, but he was aroused by WOL. I.

Down flight after flight of the interminable steps he dashed with reckless haste, often slipping, falling, and rolling, but ever keeping in advance of his pursuers. As he neared the bottom, the horror of the secret door, there to be encountered, fell on him, and he cried aloud in his agony. Like a mocking echo, his cry was repeated from above. When he reached the bottom of the last flight of steps, and could go no farther, then he would turn and fight to the bitter end. They should never again lay his breathing body on the hideous stone of sacrifice. Thus Huetzin determined; but when he came to the door, and the pursuing footsteps were close upon him, it stood open. Hardly crediting this wonder, the fugitive sprang through the opening thus miraculously provided, and slammed the heavy door behind him. Then he again ran forward through utter darkness. Feeling for the side passages that he remembered, he at length found and entered one. In this he ran, until suddenly he brought up against a solid wall, where he fell, panting, bruised, and almost unconscious, to the ground.  CHAPTER XXII. SANDOVAL PLIGHTS HIS TROTH When Sandoval returned with the others to the Spanish quarters, after leaving the temple, he urged Marina to find out who had sent the message that had despatched him on so fruitless an errand to Huitzil's shrine, and, if possible, what it meant. This Marina was only too glad to undertake; for she, as well as the young Spaniard, was anxious and unhappy concerning the fate of him who had been her patient in Tlascala. In the meantime Sandoval, visiting the Tlascalan quarters, found the fierce warriors very angry, and inclined to quarrel with some one, on account of the loss of their well-liked young chief. They could form no idea of what had become of him, but declared that if he were not restored to them soon, and in safety, the city that had swallowed him should be made to feel their vengeance. The matter was becoming so serious that it must be reported to Cortes. Upon hearing of it, the Spanish leader declared his intention of immediately visiting the king, and demanding any information he might possess upon the  SANDOVAL PLIGHTS HIS TROTH 175 subject. To this end, he summoned Marina to accompany him as interpreter. The Indian girl had but just discovered the page who had brought her the message, and gained from him the information that it had been sent by one of the court ladies, who was even now walking in the king's gardens, and to whom he would willingly conduct her. As Marina must attend the Conqueror in his audience with the king, she turned the page over to Sandoval, with instructions to lead the young cavalier to the gardens instead of herself, and point the lady

Bolívar, on being apprised of this event, determined on sending a force by sea to Guayaquil ; for the purpose either of co-operating with the new republic against the common enemy, or of advancing from thence, unassisted, towards Quito, by the road of Chimborazo and Pichincha. The command of this expedition was given to Sucre. On his return, with the defeated army, to Popayan, he delivered it up to Gen. Torres, lately arrived there with the regiment of Bogotà, and some other troops from Santa Fè. Sucre then proceeded to Cali, where a new corps had been  CAMPAIGNS AND CRUISES. 231 raised in the valley of Caüca, consisting chiefly of black recruits, and called El Batallon de Santander, in compliment to the Vice-President of Colombia. Col. MʻIntosh, of the Albions, was appointed to discipline this regiment, with the assistance of four of his officers, 25 whom he selected to take with him from Popayan. Sucre left Cali with this corps, for the port of San Buenaventura on the coast of Chocò. where he proposed to embark for Guayaquil. The road, or rather track, from the valley of Caüca, to the village of Las Juntas, (so called from two mountain torrents that meet there,) though not long, is excessively bad. The general mode of travelling, through the Montaña del Papagayo, and the hilly pass of Las Ojas, is on the shoulders of chasquis, or carriers. The recruits were much fatigued by this journey ; during which the narrowness of the paths, and thickness of the underwood, rendered it difficult to detect them in their frequent attempts at desertion, in which they consequently often succeeded, They had learned that they were to be embarked, on arriving at San Buenaventura ; and entertained such a horror of a sea voyage, that they were constantly endeavouring to escape. It, therefore, became necessary to order the few old soldiers, that were distributed into each company, to load their pieces with ball, in presence of the recruits : and directions were given them, to shoot the first that should attempt to leave the line of march. From La Juntas, canoes are employed to convey travellers and baggage down the mountain  232 CAMPAIGNS AND CRUISES. torrent, by a most singular mode of navigation. These canoes are small, flat-bottomed, and framed of a light wood ; having just room for one traveller, or at most two, and a trunk. The passengers are seated in the bottom of the canoe, on mats; and are obliged to remain perfectly steady, for the light bark descends a succession of rapids and water-falls, which would, assuredly, not be considered navigable, in any other part of the world.

She could not tell time,- there were a few things that the little Cristina did not know, and this was one of them, — but she could watch the second hand, and when it flew round to the little mark at the top she would begin to tell. Cristina was somewhat in the frame of mind of the traditional drowning man, whose entire life passes in review in the twinkling of an eye. Her past rushed pell-mell before her eyes, and her dreams of the future clamored for notice also. “If I tell, I can never buy a banana walk, and be grand Señora; and Francisco and 'Cito Mores and me, we will sit in the stocks for some days, perhaps ; perhaps they will keep us in the cep' for a year; perhaps they will take us to Saltona and shoot us dead.

That is the Señora Cordeza's.

They advanced towards the town-house, the greater proportion of their followers edging off towards a street at the other end of a building from that occupied by Vieilleville. The women and a few soldiers turned their horses towards the troop which had arrived before them. Saluzzo, (for it was he,) espying this, called after them that they had mistaken their way.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, 251 “With your pardon, fair sir,” said Marie, checking her steed, ""they are quite right. Your lodgings are at the hostelrie of the Bear, mine at that of St Denis. My cousin Vieilleville is here to relieve you of the charge I have so unwillingly imposed upon you; and you know how indecorous it would be to prefer the protection of a stranger to so near a relation. My steward will reckon with yours at Paris for any expense you may have incurred on my account. The debt of gratitude I . owe you I never can hope to pay.” And here the innate devil of coquetry resumed its sway as her spirits rose. ""I leave my heart in your keeping, fair sir. Take good care of it.” Saluzzo was too well aware of his own powers to dream of coping with Vieilleville. He saw his fairy visions melting away, and he wept for spite and sorrow. With a cowed look he took her proffered hand and pressed it to his lips. In the very wantonness of malice, she gently pressed his hand, smiled, and cast one of her most winning glances at him ; then, turning suddenly, as if to hide a blush, she cantered smilingly towards her cousin. The crestfallen marquis retired in a supereminently savage mood to his den. On reaching the hostelrie, Vieilleville presented to Marie a young knight, whom she recognised as the bearer of his litter. “The Prince of Roche-sur-Yonne, fair cousin; the playmate of your childhood, the admirer of your womanly beauties, and one who, as you well know, lately undertook a service of some danger and difficulty for your sake."" The prince was certainly an amiable and handsome young man; his late service gave him some  252 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. claim to a kind reception; and, in the course of a few hours' conversation, so many childish hours of happiness had been reawakened in Marie's memory, that she felt as if her youthful playmate and she, although separated, had never been disjoined. She persuaded herself that some invisible bond had held them together, although herself had remained unaware of it until circumstances drew the noose tighter. The prince secured his footing by a thousand delicate and unpretending attentions. On the eve of the third day, just before they entered Paris, Vieilleville reminded his cousin of the danger she incurred from the king's anxiety to see her married to Saluzzo, and urged a speedy private marriage with the prince.

I've been at work on it ever since the ship left for the first time, five weeks to-day; I shall be lucky if I finish it in another three; but it'll bring me a hundred guineas if it brings me a penny."" ""A hundred guineas,” gasped Collins, “ for eight weeks' work! Why, leaving out the Sundays, that's more than a guinea a day.” “Right you are,” said the carpenter, chuckling ; ""and that's what I shall want to earn now, whatever I work at and whoever I work for.” Poor Collins went away, and said to his wife, “We must do without that new room-the carpenter won't work now under a guinea a day; he says he can make that by sending things to San Francisco, and that he won't work for less.” Mrs. Collins was very angry. She had been out to buy cloth and various things that she wanted for the making of the clothes she intended to send away in the ship. She had found everything either about twice the price that it had been before the return of the ship, or that it was not to  86 [ıv. TALES IN POLITICAL ECONOMY. be had at any price. Not only were the goods that were sent away much dearer, but the things that were intended only for home consumption had gone up in price also. Many of the people who had been cultivators of a kind of plantain that was eaten raw, and which was a very favourite food in the island, had given up selling the fresh fruit; they were now busy in making it into a rich preserve which they intended to send away in the Carrier Pigeon; so of course those that were sold raw were much dearer: first, because their owners would have sent them all away if they did not receive a higher price at home than formerly prevailed; secondly, because those who wished to buy them had now more money in their possession in consequence of the gold brought back in the ship, and therefore they had it in their power to give the increased price demanded. Although everyone worked away with great energy to provide a second cargo for the Carrier Pigeon, the delight that had been caused by the return of the ship had now quite  Iv.] FOREIGN TRADE. died away. Nobody understood how it was, but everyone knew that, although he had more money than before, he was not so well off. The money had lost a great part of its purchasing power; it was more difficult than formerly to obtain supplies of the necessaries and comforts of life. It is not difficult for us to see how this happened ; they had sent away the things that really support life and add to its enjoyments; they had parted"

William, during his walk to Lochmore, informed Allen that business, which he could not mention, even to him, 'required his immediate presence in London. ""I must see Sir Charles directly; and, therefore, I mean to leave this place in a few hours; but Lady Beaumont must not know where I am gone at present. I could have wished, Allen, to have taken you along with me; but I know not how I can do that without exci. ting her ladyship's suspicion, and alarming her as to the nature of my business.”.. Allen stopped hastily, and, catching hold of his father's arm, said, ""I too, dear father, should wish, of all things, to go to London. Nay, I even doubt whether your business is of more consequence than mine; but till you mentioned your desire of taking me with you, I had not dared even to admit the possibility of accomplishing it. Secrecy, however, is so essential with regard to my motives for going to London, that I am not at liberty to explain them, even to you. But if you write a note to Lady Beaumont, saying, that you have determined on carrying me with you to Edinburgh, she may naturally suppose, you intend to inquire about the next winter's classes at the University for me. This notion will satisfy her mind, for at least a week or ten days ; and I hope, by that time, I shall be able, either to write to her myself, and explain the reason of my absence, or else to leave London on my return home.” ""I don't quite understand, Allen, what motive you can have for wishing so earnestly to go to London ; unless, indeed, it is to see your dear bro ARTHUR MONTEITH. 81 ther, and that is not necessary to be kept a secret; but, as you do not ask me to explain my plans, I will not press for yours.

All this, it must be owned, is very pretty; but it is also gouty and superfluous. It is too convenient, too exacting, too exclusive. We must get too much for it, and lose too much by it. Its plenty, as Ovid says, makes us poor. We neither have it in the republic of letters, nor would desire it in any less Jacobinical state. Horses, as many as you please, provided men have enough to eat ; hired coaches, a reasonable number ; but health and good-humour at all events. Gigs and curricles are things less objectionable, because they cannot be so relied upon as substitutes for exercise. Our taste in them, we must confess, is not genuine. How shall we own it? We like to be driven, instead of drive ; to read or look about us, instead of keeping watch on a horse's head. We have no relish even for vehićles of this description, that are not saſe. Danger is a good thing for giving a fillip to a man's ideas; but even danger, to us, must come recommended by something useful. We have no ambition to have TANDEM written on our tombstone. The prettiest of these vehicles is undoubtedly the curricle, which is also the safest. There is something worth looking at in the pair of horses, with that sparkling pole of steel laid across  COACHES AND THEIR HORSES. 179 them. It is like a bar of music, comprising their harmonious course. But, to us, even gigs are but a sort of unsuccessful run at gentility. The driver, to all intents and purposes, had better be on the horse. Horseback is the noblest way of being carried in the world. It is cheaper than any other constant mode of riding, it is common to all ranks, and it is manly, graceful, and healthy. The handsomest mixture of danger with dignity, in the shape of a carriage, was the tall phaeton, with its yellow wings. We remember looking up to it with respect in our childhood—partly for its own loftiness, partly for its name, and partly, perhaps, for the figure it makes in the prints to novels of that period. The most gallant figure which mere modern driving ever cut was in the person of a late Duke of Hamilton, of whom we have read or heard somewhere, that he used to dash round the streets of Rome, with his horses panting and his hounds barking about his phaeton, to the equal fright and admiration of the Masters of the World, who were accustomed to witness nothing higher than a lumbering old coach or a cardinal on a mule. A post-chaise involves the idea of travelling, which, in the company of those we love, is home in motion. The smooth running along the road, the fresh air, the variety of scene, the leafy roads, the bursting prospects, the clatter through a town, the gaping gaze of a village, the hearty appetite, the leisure (your chaise waiting

However, my grandfather did not keep up the character of a martyr at all well: he took the matter really very patiently; and when the excellent Carlota had set the dinner on the table, and he tasted the fine flavour of the maltreated ham, he speedily regained his accustomed good-humour. “ It is very strange,"" he said presently, while searching with a fork in the dish before him, “that a pair of fowls should have only three wings, two legs, and one breast between them.” It certainly was not according to the order of  TALES FROM ""BLACKWOOD."" nature; nevertheless the fact was so, all my grandfather's researches in the dish failing to bring to light the missing members. This, however, was subsequently explained by the discovery of the remains of these portions of the birds in the scullery, where they appeared to have been eaten after being grilled; and Mrs Bags' reason for adopting this mode of cooking them was also rendered apparent-viz. that she might secure a share for herself without immediate detection. However, all this did not prevent them from making the best of what was left, and the Major's face beamed as he drank Carlota's health in a glass of the remaining bottle of champagne, as brightly as if the dinner had been completely successful. “It is partly my fault, Owen,"" said the Major, “that you haven't a joint of mutton instead of this sheep's head. I ought to have been sharper. The animal was actually sold in parts before he was killed. Old Clutterbuck had secured a haunch, and he a single man, you know—'tis thrown away upon him. I offered him something handsome for his bargain, but he wouldn't part with it."" “ We're lucky to get any,"" returned Owen. “Never was such a scramble. Old Fiskin, the commissary, and Mrs O’Regan, the Major's wife, both swore the left leg was knocked down to them; neither would give in, and it was put up again, when the staff doctor, Pursum, who had just  LAZARO'S LEGACY. 13 arrived in a great hurry, carried it off by bidding eightpence more than either.

Fiskin likes a good dinner.” The dinner having been done justice to, Carlota removed the remains to a side-table, and the Major was in the act of compounding a bowl of punch, when there was a knock at the door. “Come in,"" cried Carlota. A light and timid step crossed the narrow passage separating the outer door from that of the room they sat in, and there was another hesitating tap at this latter. “Come in,” again cried Carlota, and a young girl entered with a"

The home of her childhood, where all her days of true happiness and peace had been passed, where she had been wooed by him whose early dreams of prosperity had been entirely destroyed by his own misconduct, and whose end had been so tragical, afforded her now no pleasure. Her kind parent did all in his power to alleviate her sorrow, and withdraw her mind from the melancholy which possessed it. After a while he succeeded : time insensibly weakened the vivid recollection of the past, and she felt something like a return of former peace, although happiness would never again possess her mind, when her alarm was again excited on account of her aged parent, on whom the infirmities of age were fast increasing. He was obliged to be confined to his bed ; £ and, finding his end approaching, with that consideration and love which had ever marked his character, he bequeathed a small annuity which had been his means of support for some years, to his beloved daughter, and a few days after breathed his last. She now felt herself alone and friendless in the midst of a world which had no charms for her, and which she would gladly have left, had her Almighty Father been pleased to take her. A few years after this event the death of those on whose lives her annuity depended plunged her into actual want. None of her friends now remaining were sufficiently disinterested to be at the charge of her maintenance; so that, after some time struggling against adversity, she was compelled to enter the workhouse of the village of which her late husband had been a native.

L. EDGEWORTH. [Published in 1801.7 K3   FORESTER. FORESTER was the son of an English gentleman, who had paid some attention to his education, but who had some singularities of opinion, which probably influenced him in his conduct towards his children. Young Forester was frank, brave, and generous; but he had been taught to dislike politeness so much, that the common forms of society appeared to him either odious or ridiculous; his sincerity was seldom restrained by any attention to the feelings of others. His love of independence was carried to such an extreme, that he was inclined to prefer the life of Robinson Crusoe in his desert island to that of any individual in cultivated so. ciety. His attention had been early fixed upon the follies and vices of the higher classes of people; and his contempt for selfish indolence was so strongly associated with the name of gentleman, that he was disposed to choose his friends and companions from among his inferiors : the inequality between the rich and the poor shocked him: his temper was enthusiastic as well as benevolent; and he ardently wished to be a man, and to be at liberty to act for himself, that he might reform society, or at least his own neighbourhood. When he was about nineteen years old, his father died, and young Forester was sent to Edinburgh, to Dr. Campbell, the gentleman whom his father had appointed his guardian. In the choice of his mode of travelling his disposition appeared. The stage-coach and a carrier set out nearly at the same time from Penrith. Forester, proud of bring, ing his principles immediately into action, put himself under the protection of the carrier, and congratulated himself upon his freedom from prejudice. He arrived at Edinburgh in all the glory of independence, and he desired the carrier to set him down at Dr. Campbell's door. “ The doctor's not at home,” said the footman who opened the door.  FORESTER. “ Heis at home,” exclaimed Forester, with indignation; “I see him at the window.” “ My master is just going to dinner, and can't see any body now,"" said the footman; “but if you will call again at six o'clock, maybe he may see you, my good lad."" “My name is Forester- let me in,"" said Forester pushing forwards. 6 Forester !—Mr. Forester!"" said the footman; ""the young gentleman that was expected in the coach to-day?"" Without deigning to give the footman any explanation, Forester took his own portmanteau from the carrier; and Dr. Campbell came down stairs just when the footman was officiously struggling with the young gentleman for his burden. Dr. Campbell received his pupil very kindly; but Forester would not be prevailed upon to rub his shoes sufficiently upon the mat at the bottom of the stairs, or to change his disordered dress before he made his appearance in the drawing-room. He entered with dirty shoes, a threadbare coat, and hair that looked"

On the feminine termination •ster (formerly -estre, or -stre) see the remarks in Marsh's Lectures on the English Language, printed in (the so-called) Smith's Student's Manrial of the English Language, ed. 1862, pp. 207, 208, with an additional note at p. 217. Marsh's remarks are, in this case, less clear than usual. He shews that the termination was not always used as a feminine, and that, in fact, its force was early lost. It is, however, merely a question of chronology. That the termination was originally feminine in Anglo-Saxon, is sufficiently proved by the A. S. version of the Gospels. There we find the word witega frequently used in the sense of prophet; but, in one instance, where it is necessary to express the feminine, we find this accomplished by the use of this very termination. * And anna wæs witegystre (another MS. witegestre);' i. e. and Anna was a prophetess, Luke ii. 36.

I must be content with speaking of the general effect, as it related to myself. 'I remember waking early in the morning, and from my window, which looked over the Adriatic sea, I saw the sun struggling onwards in a sea of vapor. His track appeared nearly in the point of Trieste. The waters of the gulf lay silent, stretching away south and north, a melancholy plain without life or motion. I began to augur ill of the Venetian festival, but I was agreeably disappointed. For in about an hour the god of day threw off his cloudy bondage, and looked out upon us like, what he really is in southern climates, the living wonder and paragon of the heavens. The wind began to stir and freshen, and the waves curled and broke along the shore. The distant mountains, which had before looked cold and mournful, awoke to a new life, and put on their richest colors. The people opened their windows, there was a hum of voices and laughing, and the splashing of water in the canals below. One after one, the little boats and gondolas shot out from creeks and corners, and shook their tiny streamers to the breeze; men and women, in new gay dresses, were seen; rowers and gondolieri, and holi 132 A DAY IN VENICE. day-making girls from the neighboring continent, while the servants seemed to go about blithely on their morning errands. It was clear that the day would be in our favor, and accordingly we prepared to do it honor, by displaying before the curious Venetian ladies some of the elegances of our English apparel. We had ordered a gondola to be ready early, and after we had taken our coffee, we descended to where it lay waiting our arrival. “The time appointed for the procession not having arrived, we bade the gondolieri row us through some of the different streets of the city, to witness the preparations that were making in all quarters from the Doge to the beggar. The English traveller who has not visited this corner of Italy, cannot have any idea of the delight of gliding along from street to street, by churches and palaces and marble houses, without an effort of his own. It is more like the motion which we enjoy (or seem to enjoy) in a dream than anything else. I lay on the soft cushions of the gondola, and from underneath the pleasant shadow which the cur. tains made, I looked up at the architectural splendors; at windows filled with eastern-looking women, some gazing on the boats below, some glancing at the sky, (to see if the day were likely to be overcast,) some arranging their hair, and others listening to the cavaliers who hung over them, telling tales probably as sweet and as welcome as those which were listened to in former days, in the romantic gardens of Boccaccio. • After some time spent in this manner, we

The boat was hailed, and the rower, instantly recognizing his benefactor, sprung on shore, and, unmindful of the splendid company which surrounded him, fell at Lord Arranmore's feet: with all the promptitude of Irish gratitude and its hyberbole, he burst into tears, kissed his hands, and uttered many exclamations of surprise and delight, at so unexpected a meeting. “ Here is a scene !"" said Lady Honoria. “ What does it all mean, Lord Arranmore?” demanded Lady Knocklofty, in the hope she would be called on for a sensation.

The grooms, under the guidance of the shepherd-boy, took the horses towards the shore; where, at the distance of a mile, was a tighleana, or house of reception, opposite to which, stood a second ferry. The boat then put off : the nars sparkler  184 THE O'BRIENS AND advanced, and in less than a quarter of an hour, the party landed. With a simultaneous expression of surprise and admiration, they paused. The Abbey of Moycullen, after the lapse of ages, still preserved all its beautiful gothic forms: and, submitting more to the aggressions of time, than of man (though grey and moss-covered, mouldering, and decayed), still exhibited a most striking and picturesque exterior. The intricacies of the mountain passes, which led to it by land, had probably saved it from the spoliations of Cromwell's soldiery ; though the ferocious fanatics had penetrated into the deepest gorges of the Galway mountains, wherever monastic establishments had held out the lure of plunder.* The curiously-ribbed oak-roof of the church, with its arched and ornamented entrance of the Saxon Gothic, its great window perfect in its delicate tracery, and recently filled with stained glass, together with its belfry and cloisters, were in the highest preservation; while, lying Not very far from Moycullen, at Aughnanure, twentyseven priests were put to death by the Cromwellites.

Hippocrates, in describing the robust temperament, tells us that the athlete prepare themselves for the gymnasium by strong exertion, which they continued till they felt fatigue; they then reposed till they felt returning strength and aptitude for labour : and thus, by alternate exercise and indulgence, their limbs acquired the firmest tone of health and vigour. We have found that those who have tasted with the keenest relish the beauties of Berquin, Day, or Barbauld, pursue a demonstration of Euclid, or a logical deduction, with as much eagerness, and with more rational curiosity, than is usually shown by students who are nourished with the hardest fare and chained to unceasing labour. “ Forester"" is the picture of an eccentric charactera young man who scorns the common forms and dependencies of civilized society; and who, full of visionary schemes of benevolence and happiness, might, by improper management or unlucky circumstances, have become a fanatic and a criminal, The scene of “ The Knapsack” is laid in Sweden, to produce variety, and to show that the rich and poor the young and old, in all countries, are mutually serviceable to each other; and to portray some of those virtues which are peculiarly amiable in the character of a soldier. “ Angelina” is a female Forester. The nonsense of sentimentality is here aimed at with the shafts of ridicule, instead of being combated by serious argument.

The “ Prussian Vase” is a lesson against imprudence and on exercise of judgment, and a eulogium upon our inestimable trial by jury.

In “ The Good Aunt” the advantages which a judicious early education confers upon those who are intended for public seminaries are pointed out.

Dr. B., who imagined that the sailor might have something to do with the business in question, ordered that he might be shown into the room. “I wants one Gregory Giles, a stage-coachman, if such a one be here amongst ye, gentlefolks, and nobody else,” cried the sailor, producing a parcel, wrapped up in brown paper. “It's my very parcel !” exclaimed the stage-coachman. “1 am Gregory Giles! God bless your honest heart !—Where did ye find it?-Give it me!”  216 THE GOOD AUNT. The sailor said he had found it in a dry ditch on the Bath road, a little beyond the first turnpike, going out of town; that he had inquired at the turnpike-house; had heard that the stage had been overturned a few days before, and that a parcel had been lost, about which the coachman had been in great trouble; that he had gone directly to the inn where the coach put up; had traced the coachman from place to place; and was heartily glad he had found him at last. “Thank’ee, with all my heart,” said the coachman, ""for all the trouble you've been at; and here's the crown reward that I offered for it, and my thanks into the bargain.” . “No, no,"" said the honest sailor, pushing back the money; “I won't take any thing from a poor fellow like myself: put your silver into your pocket: I hear you lost your place already by that parcel. There was a great talk at the turnpike-house about your losing your place, for giving some young gentleman a lift.—Put up your money."" All present were eager in rewarding the honest sailor. A hackney-coach was now come to the door for Mr. Carat, and every body hurried off as fast as possible. "" Where are they all steering to ?” said the sailor. The stagecoachman told him all that he had heard of the matter. “I'll be in their wake, then,” cried the sailor; “I shall like to see the Jew upon his court-martial ; I was choused once by a Jew myself.” He got to Bow-street as soon as they did. The first thing Howard learned was, that the jewels, which had been all found at Mr. Carat’s, precisely answered the description which his aunt had given of them. The Jew was in the utmost consternation : finding that the jewels were positively sworn to, he declared, upon his examination, that he had bought them from a captain of a ship; that he had paid the full value for them; and that, at the time he purchased them, he had no suspicion of their"

She was a woman of an excellent heart, and absolutely incapable of suspecting that others could be less frank or friendly than herself. She was sometimes led into mistakes by this undistinguishing benevolence; for she imagined that all which appeared wrong would prove right, if properly understood; that there must be some good reason for every thing that seemed to be bad; that every instance of unkindness or insolence was undesigned; and that every quarrel was only a misunderstanding. Possessed by this good-natured kind of wrong-headedness, she frequently did the most provoking, by way of doing the most obliging things imaginable. Upon this principle she would place contending parties by surprise in the very situation which of all others they most wished to avoid, and then give the signal for a pitched battle, by begging the enemies would shake hands with one another. Now she had heard it reported in Yorkshire that there was some coolness between the Elmours and Miss Turnbull; but she was morally certain there could be no truth in this report, for a variety of the very best reasons in the world. ""In the first place,"" argued Mrs. Wynne, ""to my certain knowledge, Miss Turnbull was, from her infancy, always the greatest favourite at Elmour Grove, the pupil of the good old gentleman, and the intimate friend of the daughter. During that odd Hodgkinson's lifetime, Almeria was always with Miss Ellen Elmour, who treated her quite like a sister.

Then she had stronger reasons afterwards for being attached to them—you know it was Mr. Frederick Elmour who gained her large fortune for her. I was in the court-house in York the very day the cause was decided, and I never heard a man speak with more energy and eloquence than Frederick Elmour did in her defence. It was plain, indeed, that the eloquence came from his heart—as to the law part of the business, I know my nephew, who understands those things, said it was a very nice question, and that if her tause had not been managed as ably as it was, she would not have gained her fortune. Now of course this was a thing that never could be forgotten. I own, I expected that there would have been a match between Miss Turnbull and Mr. Elmour; but Sir Thomas Stock, her guardian, took her away from us, and Mr. Elmour fell in love with another lady. But all this time Miss Turnbull has never married, though she has been so"

Nonsensical allusions pass off very prettily in 'conversation. I mean, when we converse with partial friends : but we should reason ill, and conduct ourselves worse, if we were to trust implicitly to poetical analogies. Our affoctions,” continued Lady Anne, “ arise from circumstances totally independent of our will."" “That is the very thing I meant to say,"" interrupted Belinda, eagerly. “ They are excited by the agreeable or useful qualities that we discover in things or in persons.” • Undoubtedly,” said Belinda. “Or by those which our fancies discover,” said Lady Anne. Belinda was silent; but, after a pause, she said, “That it was certainly very dangerous, especially for women, to trust to fancy in bestowing their affections."" “And yet,” said Lady Anne, “it is a danger to which they are much exposed in society. Men have it in their power to assume the appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable, and women have scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit.” “Without Ithuriel's spear, how can they distinguish the good from the evil ?” said Belinda. “This is a commonplace complaint, I know; the ready excuse that we silly young women plead, when we make mistakes for which our friends reproach us, and for which we too often reproach ourselves.” “ The complaint is commonplace precisely because it is general and just,” replied Lady Anne. “In the slight and frivolous intercourse, which fashionable belles usually have with these fashionable beaux who call themselves their lovers, it is surprising that they can discover any thing of each other's real character. Indeed they seldom do; and this probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy marriages.

The night without was the most formidable contrast to the night within. Tempest in all its shapes was doing its wild will, from the Zenith to the Nadir. Thunder, lightning, and rain had met, as if by general consent, to celebrate their orgies over the capital of Tuscany. Cavalry, cabriolets, and chasseurs, all had disappeared, and the lover, raging with impatience, fear, and passion, felt how empty a thing it is to be but an ambassador, or even that more potential thing, the secretary to an ambassador. However, the lady's danger prohibited delay, and throwing his cloak round him, he rushed into the deserted streets, through ways that might have  THE PREMIER AND HIS WIFE. 67 repulsed Hannibal or Napoleon at the head of their braves, and under a deluge from skies and roofs, which left little to be filled up by the imagination on this side of Niagara.

An Englishman in a foreign city is proverbially, of all animals, the most easily perplexed. He loses his way by nature. Montfort was no more gifted with the “organ of direction"" than the rest of his countrymen; and at the first turning from the palace, and while the flash of its hundred windows was still gleaming in his eyes, he was as much astray as if he had bivouacked in an American prairie. But Cupid never deserts his true votaries. The storm which had drenched him, and the darkness which had forced him to feel his way from portico to portico, brought him full upon an overturned coach. A group of muffled figures were round it, and the twinkle of a lantern in one of their hands showed him the fair Matilda fainting on the shoulder of a tall ruffian, with a mask on his face, and a huge Inspruck cut-and-thrust flourishing in his hand. This was an adventure in the established style.  TALES FROM ""BLACKWOOD."" A more considerate lover would have paused to ascertain whether the design was upon the lady's person or her purse ; whether she was not carried off with her own consent, and whether an intruder might not get the Inspruck cut-and-thrust through his præcordia.

I had recklessly invested my whole capital in the shares of a certain railway company, which for the present shall be nameless; and each successive circular from my broker conveyed the doleful intelligence that the stock was going down to Erebus. Under these circumstances I certainly felt very far from being comfortable. I could not sell out except at a ruinous loss; and I could not well afford to hold on for any length of time, unless there was a reasonable prospect of a speedy amendment of the market. Let me confess it-I had of late come out rather too strong. When a man has made money easily, he is somewhat prone to launch into expense, and to presume too largely upon his credit. I had been idiot enough to make my debut in the sporting world—had started a couple of horses upon the verdant turf of Paisley -and, as a matter of course, was remorselessly sold by my advisers. These and some other minor amusements had preyed deleteriously upon my purse."

I remember nothing of the journey from the time we left the hoteldoor, except that it was fearfully long. At some hour of the day with which I was not acquainted (for my watch had stopped for want of winding up), I was set down in a clean little street of a prim little town (the name of which I never thought of asking), and was told that the coach never went any further. No postchaise was to be had. With incredible difficulty I got first a gig, then a man to drive it; and, last,  A ROGUE'S LIFE. 273 a pony to draw it. We hobbled away crazily from the inn door. I thought of Screw and the Bow Street runner approaching Crickgelly, from their point of the compass, perhaps at the full speed of a good post-chaise – I thought of that, and would have given all the money in my pocket for two hours' use of a fast road-hack, Judging by the time we occupied in making the journey, and a little also by my own impatience, I should say that Crickgelly must have been at least twenty miles distant from the town where I took the gig. The sun was setting, when we first heard, through the evening stillness, the sound of the surf on the sea-shore. The twilight was falling as we entered the little fishing village, and let our unfortunate pony stop, for the last time, at a small inn door. The first question I asked of the landlord was, whether two gentlemen (friends of mine, of course, whom I expected to meet) had driven into Crickgelly, a little while before me. The reply was in the negative; and the sense of relief it produced seemed to rest me at once, body and mind, after my long and anxious journey. Either I had beaten the spies on the road, or they were not bound to Crickgelly. Any way, I had first possession of the field of action. I paid the man who had driven me, and asked my way to Zion Place. My directions were simple – I had only to go through the village, and I should find Zion Place at the other end of it. The village had a very strong smell, and a curious habit of building boats in the street between intervals of detached cottages; a helpless, muddy, fishy little place.

Catherine Lemoins, the other servant, confirmed the evidence, and added that on her return from fetching the eggs, she went straight to the room occupied by the Sieur de la Pivardière and found him just dead; that she desired the two valets to take away the body and bury it, but did not tell them where; and that then she went and prepared supper. After supper the men departed.  160 TIIE FRENCHMAN OF TWO WIVES. More than thirty witnesses, most of them friends of Madame de la Pivardière, deposed to the fact of the assassination, and confirmed the evidence of the two servants in many ways. All doubt about this tragedy was at an end — at least in Châtillon sur l'Indre, where the inquiry had taken place. But, now began the extraordinary part of this remarkable story. Tidings came from Ramorantin, a town on the other side of Nerbonne, that Monsieur de la Pivardière had been seen there alive and well subsequently to the fifteenth of August, the night of his asserted murder. Madame de la Pivardière continued to assert her innocence, and caused search to be everywhere made for her husband. From the letter that had roused her jealousy, she had an idea that he would be found at Auxerre or in the neighbourhood. On inquiry, the whole story of his marriage under the name of Bouchet, and of his having filled the situation of huissier, came to light. Bouchet, or more properly La Pivardière, himself, had been at Auxerre within the last few days; but had departed suddenly. The messengers sent by his wife tracked him and came up with him at Flavique. He was alive and well, and no one had ever made the least attempt to murder him. His account of himself was straightforward enough, and fully explained all that was mysterious in his disappearance. “Scarcely,” said he, ""had I retired to my room on the night of my return to Nerbonne, when Catherine Lemoins came to me and told me that if I remained till morning in the château I ran the risk of being arrested.

It was one of the few in which regularity, in that respect, was at all attended to. The uniform was dark green, a colour well suited to the complexion of most of those who wore it; and on the front of their schacos was first displayed the device, which was afterwards so generally adopted, of “ MUERTE, O LIBERTAD!” The patriot army could not boast, at that time, of any native artillery officers; but this deficiency was supplied by a number of foreign volunteers. As most of these were either Frenchmen, or creoles of Martinico and Santa Lucia, the term  166 THE EARTHQUAKE Francezes was applied indiscriminately to all foreigners, at the commencement of the revolutionary war. It is recorded, for instance, in the Venezuelan national song, that“ Veinte cinco Francézes “ Cargaban su canòn :“ Alòn, alòn, camina ! “Alòn, mozos, alòn ! ” The guerilléros, commanded by the old chief Zaráza, were necessarily objects of suspicion when bivouacked in the neighbourhood of towns and cities ; for their habits of foraging, contracted while on a campaign, were rather difficult to shake off, even when among friends and allies. They were therefore detached by Miranda beyond the lagoon of Maracaybo, towards the borders of the province of Coro. By this politic arrangement, the Venezuelan Government reaped the united advantages of harrassing their unfriendly neighbours, maintaining a corps of observation in front of the declared enemy, and keeping an useful and efficient, though capricious and irregular, body of men in good humour. It afforded the guerilla facili ies of enjoying without interruption those little "" privilegios de guerra,” which must otherwise have been exercised at the expence of their fellow citizens, or, if altogether withheld, would inevitably have led to disgust and desertion.

Besides these, several small corps were in motion towards head-quarters, under Bermudez, Mariño, and other leaders, whose enthusiasm, and devotion to their country's cause, it was hoped, would atone for their unavoidable deficiencies in military skill and experience.

I could not sport with a fiction that came so near to the fact. I became too natural in my acting to succeed. And then, what a situation for a lover! I was a mere stripling, and she played with my passion; for girls soon grow more adroit and knowing in these matters than your awkward youngsters. What agonies had I to suffer ! Every time that she danced in front of the booth, and made such liberal displays of her charms, I was in torment. To complete my misery, I had a real rival in Harlequin, an active, vigorous, knowing varlet, of six-and-twenty. What had a raw, inexperienced youngster like me to hope from such a competition ? I had still, however, some advantages in my favor. In spite of my change of life, I retained that indescribable something which always distinguishes the gentleman ; that something which dwells in a man's air and deportment, and not in his clothes ; and which is as difficult for a gentleman to put off, as for a vulgar fellow to put on. The company generally felt it, and used to call me Little Gentleman Jack. The girl felt it too, and, in spite of her predilection for my powerful rival, she liked to flirt with me. This only aggravated my troubles, by increasing my passion, and awakening the jealousy of her party-colored lover. ""A fine old park to the south of Greenwich.

(excuse my passion) the villain laid on with a malicious good-will : nay, I could absolutely hear him chuckle and laugh beneath his accursed mask--I beg pardon for growing a little warm in my narrative—I wish to be cool, but these recollections will sometimes agitate me. I have heard and read of many desperate and deplorable situations of lovers, but none, I think, in which true love was ever exposed to so severe and peculiar a trial. This could not last long; flesh and blood, at least such flesh and blood as mine, could not bear it. I had repeated heart-burnings and quarrels with my rival, in which he treated me with the mortifying forbearance of a man toward a child. Had he quarrelled outright with me, I could have stomached it, at least I should have known what part to take ; but to be humored and treated as a child in the presence of my mistress, when I felt all the bantam spirit of a little"

Now we shall see how it was in the Philippine Islands when they were still a Spanish possession. Every man and woman had to pay a poll-tax, a man from seven dollars and fifty cents to twentyfive dollars a year, and a woman from five dollars to fourteen dollars a year. A male servant earned about four dollars a month, or forty-eight dollars a year, and had to support himself and his family if he had any, from these wages. It was very hard on him to pay the government almost one-sixth of his income for poll-tax alone. And this was not the only tax. If he lived in a hut worth only five dollars, he must pay one dollar and fifty cents taxes; if he had any furniture, it was taxed. If he had a cocoanut-tree, he could not gather the nuts without a permit, for which he had to pay. The farmer could not plow or sow; he could not reap his harvest without a permit, which cost money. When a child was born, it was taxed; if a man and woman married, there was a tax. When a person died, he could not be buried before one dollar and fifty cents was paid to the government. And what was done with all this money? Our government spends it for the people. We make improvements, such as public roads, remove bars from our rivers and harbors, build lighthouses, etc.,  HOW SPAIN RULED THE ISLANDS. 93 all of which benefit the people. Very little of the money taken from the people of the Philippines was spent for them. There were a number of lazy Spaniards with large salaries. These salaries were paid from the taxes.

If Monk’s mind was then made up concerning the part which he designed to perform, he, at least, was determined to keep his purpose secret in his own bosom, and declined, therefore, though civilly, to hear any proposition on the part of the banished family. The accounts which the little exiled court received concerning Monk's advance into England were equally disconsolate. All intercourse with the Cavaliers had been carefully avoided by the cloudy and mysterious soldier, in whose hands Fortune seemed to place the fate of the British kingdoms. The general belief was, that Monk would renew, in his own person, the attempt in which Cromwell had succeeded and Lambert had failed, and again place a military commander at the head of the Government; and it seemed confirmed by his harsh treatment of the City. While Charles and his attendants were in this state of despondence, they were suddenly astonished by the arrival from England of a partizan, named Baillie, an Irish Royalist, who had travelled with extreme rapidity to bring the exiled Prince the news of Monk’s decided breach with 20 vol. 1.  230 THE RESTORATION. the remnant of the Long Parliament, and the temper which had been displayed by the City of London when it became public. They listened to the messenger as they would have done to one speaking in a dream. Overwearied and fatigued by the journey, and strongly excited by the importance of the intelligence which he brought them, the officer seemed rather like one under the influence of temporary derangement or intoxication, than the deliberate bearer of great tidings. His character was, however, known as a gentleman of fidelity and firmness, and they heard with wonder that London was blazing with bonfires, that the universal wish of the people of all sorts, boldly and freely expressed, demanded the restoration of the King to his authority, and that Monk had insisted upon the summoning of a free Parliament, which the junto had no longer the power of opposing. He produced also a copy of Monk's letter to the Parliament, to show that the General had completely broken with that body. Other messengers soon confirmed the joyful tidings, and Sir John Grenville was despatched to London in all haste, with full powers to offer the General every thing which could gratify ambition or love of wealth, on condition of his proving the friend of Charles at this crisis. This faithful and active Royalist reached the metropolis, and cautiously refusing to open his commission to any one, obtained a private interview with the mysterious and reserved General. He boldly communicated his credentials, and remained unappalled, when Monk, stepping back in surprise, asked him, with some emotion, how he dared become the bearer of such proposals. Sir John replied boldly, that all danger which might be incurred in obedience to his Sovereign's command had become familiar to him from frequent practice, and that the

Under the Protectorate, the confidence in the government persuaded the wealthier merchants and gold-dealers to consider the forming of a bank. The Restoration the more completely extinguished the idea, as the character of kings barred out the probability of success or even uninterrupted trial under their sceptre. Charles II.'s ministers had distinctly and gratefully acknowledged that no government was possible if the bankers had not paid off the Cromwellian soldiers who would not lay down their arms with arrears unsettled. Yet in 1672, money being requisite to fight Holland, where the banished Stuart had spent a bitter exile, he seized all the money deposited with the government for pure safe-keeping. He offered one payment of 6 per cent. only. Restitution was partially made in a peculiarly Merry Monarch vein ; but the breach of faith was irreparable, the ghost of a national bank had been laid. The government, of the Prince of Orange sadly wanted confidence in his solidity of attachment to his new country to be spread, and William fretted under the same need of money to war against France. His creature Michael Godfrey, and favourite Bishop, Burnet, assisted by William Paterson, a brother Scot, drew up a national bank conception which met the royal sanction. Burnet had studied the Dutch bank system in working on the spot. Paterson knew a little of everything. He was a Dugald Dalgetty, as much of an arithmetician as Cassio, with a spice of the devil in Fernando Cortez. Like all needy wits, he could toss millions about with a confidence of  70 THE FOUNDER OF THE BANK. catching them which he would not have shown in haggling with a crown in his pocket for a new sword-tag. Montague (afterwards Lord Halifax), appreciated Paterson's ardent spirit and fervent imagination. Besides, anything but direct taxation which would also procure immediate funds, was acceptable beforehand. - Burnet patronised the Dumfries man because he had been originally trained for the church. The king and cabinet being eager, Parliament was most dexterously kneaded, for the leaven of land holders were hostile. By tacking the Bank Act to the tail of one concerning a raising of supplies, the mighty germ of an institution, apparently indisseverable from the crown and constitution, was smuggled through the legislative body. The royal signature was affixed 27th July, 1694. In return for the privileges £1,200,000 was lent at 8 per cent. The programme was thus couched :-It will rescue the government from extortioners, raise fund value, lower interest, revive public credit, extend the circulation, improve commerce, facilitate the annual supplies, and connect the people with its rulers. On the other hand, able voices, and many, accused it as a monopoly which would engross all the money, tempt it out of trade, enable brokers and the like to prey, encourage frauds and commercial gambling, corrupt national morals, and be used

MACNIEL That long, narrow, and irregular island, usually called the Mainland of Zetland, because it is by far the largest of that Archipelago, terminates, as is well known to the mariners who navigate the stormy seas which surround the Thule of the ancients, in a cliff of immense height, entitled Sumburgh Head, which presents its bare scalp and naked sides to the weight of a tremendous surge, forming the extreme point of the isle to the south east. This lofty promontory is constantly exposed to the current of a strong and furious tide, which, setting in betwixt the Orkney and Zetland Islands, and running with force only inferior to that of the Pentland Firth, takes its name from the headland we have mentioned, and is called the Roost of Sumburgh ; ""roost” being the phrase assigned in these isles to currents of this description. On the land side the promontory is covered with short grass, and slopes steeply down to a little isthmus, upon which the sea has encroached in creeks, which, advancing from either side of the island, gradually work their way forward, and seem as if in a short time they would form a junction, and altogether insulate Sumburgh Head, when what is now a cape will become a  10 THE PIRATE. lonely mountain islet, severed from the mainland, of which it is at present the terminating extremity. Man, however, had in former days considered this as a re mote or unlikely event ; for a Norwegian chief of other times, or as other accounts said, and as the name of Yarlshof seemed to imply, an ancient Earl of the Orkneys had selected this neck of land as the place for establishing a mansion-house. It has been long entirely deserted, and the vestiges only can be discerned with difficulty ; for the loose sand, borne on the tempestuous gales of those stormy regions, has overblown, and almost buried, the ruins of the buildings; but in the end of the seventeenth century a part of the Earl's mansion was still entire and habitable. It was a rude building of rough stone, with nothing about it to gratify the eye, or to excite the imagination ; a large old-fashioned narrow house, with a very steep roof, covered with flags composed of gray sandstone, would perhaps convey the best idea of the place to a modern reader. The windows were few, very small in size, and distributed up and down the building with utter contempt of regularity. Against the main structure had rested, in former times, certain smaller compartments of the mansion-house, containing offices, or subordinate apartments, necessary for the Earl's retainers and menials. But these had become ruinous; and the rafters had been taken down for firewood, or for"

Gerard was thunderstruck. He stood for a moment speechless with rage and astonishment. This was a catastrophe he had never bargained for. No, poor fellow, i.e had expected to receive at Elinor's hands sweetest pity and commiseration. He determined not to leave the room without an attempt at an explanation; so he followed them, and began, gently: “Will you not let me explain "" But Elinor was too thoroughly angry to listen to reason, and she faced him, haughtily. “Thank you, Mr. St. Hilary, that is quite unnecessary. I assure you it is not of the slightest consequence.” With a frigid little bow she passed away, leaving Gerard with anything but a pleasant expression on his usually pleasant face. He stood and watched them go down the room; he saw Captain Gurney bend toward her, as though he were saying something especially tender; and the sight of that, and the sound of the light laugh with which Elinor answered it, were more than he could bear. He rushed out of the room, and, entering the first cab, ordered the man to drive as quickly as possible back to barracks. “Tell you what, George,” said one of his tormentors to * “I wish I was well out of this joke: that fellow will go mad.” w  18 CAVALRY LIFE. “Umph! Gurney is such a beggar for running an idea to death.” Gerard reached his room in a state of misery too intense for words. He felt sick and dizzy and was thankful that, for once, his bed had been left in decent order. Sleep, however, he could not. He tossed about to and fro; his bed was hot and uncomfortable; and first one and then another of his comrades disturbed him by coming along the corridor with clanking of spurred boots. At last he sank into a troubled, fretful doze, which lasted until Jones came to wake him at six o'clock, for he was orderlyofficer that day. When the candles were lighted, what Gerard in his agony called the “fiendishness of the plot” was revealed: from head to foot he was as white as any miller.

And seen through such thoughts and feelings, how sad are some moments, filled with what i37  Trinity Bells we call pleasure; how much more pathetic the songs and smiles that fill them than even sighs and tears! Both old women were thinking of the days of their youth gone forever, and of the Eternal Youth to which every day was bringing them nearer.

Then Madame roused herself; she put away her knitting and began to move about the room, to open closets and to take out chocolate and sweet cakes and some of the children's rollichies. She gave her whole attention to this employment until Femmetia suddenly asked: ""Is it not your time to be saying something, Madame? Listen! What is it they are singing?

He never likes to say anything against the boys, if he can help it.

This, however, looks like it.” “You think he might have wanted to go out to play billiards with young Mr Wilder again,” suggested the constable. “But I think that can hardly have been so. I remember the matter of which you speak, and the Colonel asked us to keep an eye on a gentleman, who had been a friend of his son, and had been in the habit of going to this table, and we always have kept our eyes open, so far as that billiard-room is concerned.

Along the coast were lovely little coves and bays, enlivened by neatly laid out mansions of the planters, while numerous fishing and passage-boats, with their raking masts and latteen sails, added life and animation to the scene. A bright and sparkling stream, which found its way down from the mountains above, passed through the plantation, and added much to the refreshing coolness of the scene in that warm climate. A broad verandah ran round the house, on one side of which or the other shade could be obtained at all times of the day. A couple of days had been spent very pleasantly at this abode, when one evening, just as the sun was about to sink through a rain cloud into the distant horizon, an old whiteheaded slave came hurriedly into the presence of his master. ""What is the matter, Cassar,"" asked Mr. Jefferson, the planter. The old man shook his head. ""Very bad, very bad."" ""Speak, boy; have you lost your wits?"" exclaimed the planter impatiently. ""No, massa; but me hear there come one hundred Caribs and many white men, and a whole lot of negroes, to burn the house this night and the plantations; and they swear that they will kill all the people.""  The Heir of Kilfinnan. At first the planter was inclined to laugh at this information, so indeed was the Earl; but, on a further examination, the statements of the negro were so clear—and he was so well able to explain how he obtained his knowledge—that they began to think more seriously. ""It is too late now,"" observed the planter, ""for your lordship to attempt to return to the town; indeed, you would be very likely to fall in with these rebels; but I have several trusty slaves on the estate who I am sure would be ready to lay down their lives for my sake. I will send Caesar to summon them into the house, and as I know that we can make a better stand here than at the residences of any of the other planters, I shall be able to persuade several of them to come here with their families, and assist in the defence of the place."" ""In the mean time we must send off for assistance,"" observed the Earl; ""I am perfectly ready to agree to your proposition; indeed, I should be very unwilling to attempt to travel with my two young ladies and son at this hour; besides which we should probably be watched, and if we were so, we should eventually be captured by these people.

They assured him that it was inhabited wholly by women, who, at a certain time of the year, were visited by the Caribs. If the children born to these were boys, they were brought up to a certain age, and sent to their fathers; if girls, they were retained by their mothers. They reported also that these women had certain subterraneous caves, in which they would take refuge and hide themselves, if men came to the island at any other than the appointed season. Francisco Orellana, the second in command under Pizarro, reported on his return to Spain after his voyage down the Maranon, that he had met with a republic of women, on the banks of that river; and Condamine, after a careful examination of the question, considers that there is good ground for believing in the existence of a community of armed women, once living somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Amazon, though they have now disappeared."" (Prescott, “Peru,"" p. 150.) Sir W. Raleigh made this question his particular study. ""I N 2  180 Travellers' Tales. made inquirie,” he writes, “among the most ancient and best travelled of the Oranoqueponi, and I had knowledge of all the rivers between the Orinoco and the Amazon, and was very anxious to understand the truth about these warlike women, because of some it is believed, of others, not. And though I digress from my purpose, yet I will set down that which has been delivered to me for truth of these women. I spoke with a Cacique, a lord of the people, who told me that he had been on the river, and beyond it also. The nations of those women are on the south side of that river, and their chief strengths are in the island situated on the south side of the entrance, some sixty leagues within the mouth of the said river."" Raleigh then mentions the habits, &c., ascribed to the Amazons by the classical writers, and adds: “But they which are not far from Guiana, do keep company with men but once a year, and for the time of one month; which I gather, by their relation, to be April. At that time all the kings of the borders assemble, and the Queens of the Amazons, and after the queens have chosen their husbands, the rest cast lots for theirs. This one month they feast, dance, sing, and drink wine in abundance; and the moon being done they all return to their own provinces. If a son be born to them, they return him to his father, and if a daughter, they nourish and keep it. But that they cut off their breasts, I do not find to be true.

She did not entertain any such desponding ideas with regard to the chances of future intercourse, but she did not consider it necessary to contradict him; she only said :“Good-bye!” He kissed her hand two or three times, and then, running out of the room, disappeared within the chaise. May had some scruples of conscience on the point as to whether she had not been too kind to him at last. But she had felt, as many others probably have done, that it is hard to say good-bye, and to part with one who seems sorry to go, without expressing sorrow and kind feelings in return, even when the separation is in other respects a matter of indifference. 12*  138 MAY AND DECEMBER.

Much ADO ABOUT NOTHING. The party who remained at Littlemere was a very quiet one, and the conversation which passed between them might be easily comprised within a couple of octavo pages of large print and wide margin. Messrs. Arnold and Luttrell never talked unnecessarily, and Miss Wildey seldom spoke except in answer to some question, unless on very exciting occasions indeed, such as Mr. Arnold's upsetting the furniture in a passion, or the appearance of a wandering spider travelling over the breakfast-table. On the occurrence of such startling events, a little exclamation, or even a loud expression of horror might be forgiven; and at all other moments, her conduct manifested a calm serenity most praiseworthy and agreeable. As to May herself, the only one of the party whose natural disposition would have induced her to give vent to her feelings in words, had they been of a lively nature, she was apparently suffering from a depression of spirits which kept her as silent and grave as her companions. The past and the future weighed on her mind, but she could hardly have given any distinct account of her sentiments, or have told whether doubt or security preponderated in her heart. Thus September slipped away, and about the beginning of October Mr. Cameron's letters began to promise some change and variety.

A little breeze had sprung up mean138  A VOYAGE OVER-SEAS while from over Newfoundland way, and the heavy rolls of mist rose slowly and went scurrying off to leeward, leaving the fair little French town of St. Pierre all uncurtained before us. We exclaimed at the rude beauty of this sudden vision, and I felt, for one, that if even now our quest proved vain, the voyage to such a delightful spot was well worth the time and trouble we had expended upon it. Picture to yourself a village of about three thousand souls nestled near the top of some noble Alpine mountain, far up above the timber line, where there are no trees, no bushes, no verdure of any kind—only bleak, bare, dun-colored rocks that tower a thousand feet or more above the slated roofs and the church steeples. Then let your imagination raise the sea up to the very edge of this Alpine village; dot the tortuous outer harbor with surfsmitten bowlders; place here and there a little white light-house clinging to one of 139  FOUR FOR A FORTUNE these slippery pedestals, crowd the inner basin with hundreds of luggers, barks, and brown-sailed fishing schooners. Such is St. Pierre! It is a mountain town in mid-Atlantic.  CHAPTER XIII A BAD START We took up our lodgings in a quaint little house in a narrow lane of a street that sloped down towards the quays, and we slept peacefully that night in high mahogany bedsteads, under spreading, old-fashioned canopies. No sound disturbed our slumbers after the bold drummer had gone his rounds, rolling out curfew and beating the St. Pierrese to rest; and we were called again to the business of another day by the martial notes of the town-crier's bugle. St. Pierre rises to the clarion and retires to the scolding rumble of a sheepskin. Our first move upon sallying forth was the purchase of a map of the islands; 141  FOUR FOR A FORTUNE our second, an excursion across the harbor to the He aux Chiens. As many dogs, upon so restricted an acreage, I never saw before; and their friendliness was surpassed only by the good-natured curiosity of the islanders. Rightly was the rock named Dog Island; but, as Thatcher noted, while we searched in vain for the cross mentioned on Carquemort's chart, ""The cross seems rather to be in the breed of dogs than concretely erect upon the face of the cliff."" And, indeed, the comment was zoologically just. For, at a more or less remote period in the history of this colony some one must have imported a dachshund. That dachshund launched into a career of impetuous and reckless paternity, with the result that the influence of his breed is now plainly demonstrate in the forelegs of every cur in town.

I was quite sailor enough to understand these arrangements of our convoy, (a revenuecutter,) which were happily effected according to the commander's wish, and I felt my time for three days pass very pleasantly on board. We had abundance of fresh provisions, of wine, &c. &c., also, cards and backgammon to while away the intervals between meals. Besides the men, to the amount of nearly one hundred and fifty, we were blessed with the addition of nearly half as many women and children on board, who contracted for their own passage, as a private speculation with the captain.

After lying one night (the longest I had yet felt) at anchor at Pill, our transports on the next morning disgorged their soiled cargo, and the Loyal Leinster Regiment first touched British ground. Our parade was formed on the green sward in front of Lamp-lighters' Hall: while the arrangements for the march for Bristol were forming, and baggage loading, a part of the officers were allowed to regale on the excellent breakfast which mine host of the hall had spread for all comers, at the moderate charge of fifteen pence per mouth. The rain, which we learned had for a fortnight before prevailed throughout the country, had given way to the most delightful weather: and the interrupted, and long-deferred harvest had been resumed just as we arrived. It was in truth a delightful period of the year for a march; and the novel sights, which on every side floated in view of our poor soldiers, brought forth many an exclamation of surprise and admiration from these sons of poverty. The rich mansion, the stately timbered park, the substantial farm-house, and the comfortable cottage, called up new thoughts of their now desolate homes. Their low, unsheltered, mud-walled cabin, their unenclosed potato garden, the little rick of turf at the gable end of their hereditary hovel, all flashed across their mind; and, while they admired all that met their eye, that eye dropped a tear of sorrow as the expression “ God be with our own poor home !” broke from many a quivering lip. Bristol appeared in itself a world to hundreds of our regiment, who had never before seen a town of greater extent than three straggling avenues, known as the High Street, Chapel Street, and Church Street, distinctions sufficiently explanatory!

I turned my back upon it with a sigh, and rambled to another part of the country. How thoughtful a little adversity makes one! As I came within sight of the schoolhouse where I had so often been flogged in the cause of wisdom, you would hardly have recognized the truant boy, who, but a few years since, had eloped so heedlessly from its walls. I leaned over the paling of the play-ground, and watched the scholars at their games, and looked to see if there might not be some urchin among them like I was once, full of gay dreams about life and the world. The play-ground seemed smaller than when I used to sport about it. The house and park, too, of the neighboring squire, the father of the cruel Sacharissa, had shrunk in size and diminished in magnificence. The distant hills no longer appeared so far off, and, alas ! no longer awakened ideas of a fairy land beyond. As I was rambling pensively through a neighboring meadow, in which I had many a time gathered primroses, I met the very pedagogue who had been the tyrant and dread of my boyhood. I had sometimes vowed to myself, when suffering under his rod, that I would have my revenge if  204 TALES OF A TRAVELLER ever I met him when I had grown to be a man. The time had come; but I had no disposition to keep my vow. The few years which had matured me into a vigorous man had shrunk him into decrepitude. He appeared to have had a paralytic stroke. I looked at him, and wondered that this poor helpless mortal could have been an object of terror to me; that I should have watched with anxiety the glance of that failing eye, or dreaded the power of that trembling hand. He tottered feebly along the path, and had some difficulty in getting over a stile. I ran and assisted him. He looked at me with surprise, but did not recognize me, and made a low bow of humility and thanks. I had no disposition to make myself known, for I felt that I had nothing to boast of. The pains he had taken and the pains he had inflicted had been equally useless. His repeated predictions were fully verified, and I felt that little Jack Buckthorne, the idle boy, had grown to be a very good-for-nothing man. This is all very comfortless detail ; but as I have told you of my follies, it is meet that I show you how for once I was schooled for them. The most thoughtless of mortals will some time or other have his day of gloom, when he will be compelled to reflect. I felt on this occasion as if I had a kind of penance to perform, and I made a pilgrimage in expiation of my past levity. Having past a night at Leamington,"""

Before he entered the mallee Hawley turned in his saddle and looked furtively in the direction from which he had come, and over the jumble of porcupine ridges to the westward; then, seemingly satisfied with the survey, he rode into the centre of the thicket, dismounted, and, leaning against one  170 BENBONUNA. of the trees, gazed with a lowering brow in the direction of Baggs's hut, which, from his position, was plainly discernible.

CONTAINING PORRESTER; THE PRUSSIAN VASE ; AND THE GOOD AUNT. NEW-YORK: PUBLISHED BY HARPER & BROTHERS, NO. 82 CLIFF -STREET. 183 5.   PREFACE. It has been somewhere said by Johnson, that merely to invent a story is no small effort of the human understanding. How much more difficult is it to construct stories suited to the early years of youth, and at the same time conformable to the complicate relations of modern society-fictions that shall display examples of virtue without initiating the young reader into the ways of vice-narratives written in a style level to his capacity without tedious detail or vulgar idiom! The author, sensible of these difficulties, solicits indulgence for such errors as have escaped her vigilance. In a former work the author has endeavoured to add something to the increasing stock of innocent amusement and early instruction which the laudable exertions of some excellent modern writers provide for the rising generation; and in the present an attempt is made to provide for young people of a more advanced age a few tales that shall neither dissipate the attention nor inflame the imagination. In a work upon education which the public has been pleased to notice, we have endeavoured to show that under proper management amusement and instruction may accompany each other through many paths of literature, while at the same time we have disclaimed and reprehended all attempts to teach in play. Steady untired attention is what alone produces excellence. Sir Isaac Newton, with as much truth as modesty, attributed to this faculty those discoveries in science which brought the heavens within the grasp of man, and weighed the  PREFACE. earth in a balance. To inure the mind to athletic vig our is one of the chief objects of good education ; and we have found, as far as our limited experience has extended, that short and active exertions, interspersed"

Possessed by this good-natured kind of wrong-headedness, she frequently did the most pro ALMERIA. 223 voicing, by way of doing the most obliging things imaginable. Upon this principle she would place contending parties by surprise in the very situation which of all others they most wished to avoid, and then gave the signal for a pitched battle, by begging the enemies would shake hands with one another. Now she had heard it reported in Yorkshire that there was some coolness between the Elmours and Miss Turnbull; but she was morally certain there could be no truth in this report, for a variety of the very best reasons in the world. ""In the first place,"" argued Mrs. Wynne,"" to my certain knowledge, Miss Turnbull was, from her infancy, always the greatest favourite at Elmour Grove, the pupil of the good old gentleman, and the intimate friend of the daughter. During that odd Hodgkinson's lifetime, Almeria was always with Miss Ellen Elmour, who treated her quite like a sister. I am sure I remember, as if it was yesterday, her introducing Miss Turnbull to me, and the affectionate way in which she spoke of her; and I particularly recollect hearing Almeria Turnbull, among other grateful things, say, that she should wish to live and die with her friends at Elmour Grove. Then she had stronger reasons afterward for being attached to them—you know it was Mr. Frederick Elmour who gained her large fortune for her. I was in the courthouse in York the very day the cause was decided, and I never heard a man speak with more energy and eloquence than Frederick Elmour did in her defence. It was plain, indeed, that the eloquence came from his heart; as to the law part of the business, I know my nephew, who understands those things, said it was a very nice question, and that if her cause had not been managed as ably as it was, she would not have gained her fortune. Now of course this was a thing that never could be forgotten. I own I expected that there would have been a match between Miss Turnbull and Mr. Elmour; but Sir Thomas Stock, her guardian, took her away from us, and Mr. Elmour fell in love with another lady. But all this time Miss Turnbull has never married, though she has been so much in the great world, and from her large fortune must have had so many offers. I heard it said yesterday, that she had refused Sir Thomas Stock's eldest son, and my Lord Bradstone, and some others; now it is plain she would not marry  224 TALES OF FASHIONABLE LIFE."

Surely it is much better to let their natural affections have time to expand. If we  10 BELINDA. tear the rosebud open we spoil the flower.” Belinda smiled at this parable of the rosebud, which, she said, might be applied to men and women, as well as to children. “ And yet, upon reflection,” said Lady Anne, “the heart has nothing in common with a rosebud. Nonsensical allusions pass off very prettily in conversation. I mean, when we converse with partial friends : but we should reason ill, and conduct ourselves worse, if we were to trust implicitly to poetical analogies. Our affoctions,” continued Lady Anne, -"" arise from circumstances totally independent of our will.""

Belinda was silent; but, after a pause, she said, "" That it was certainly very dangerous, especially for women, to trust to fancy in bestowing their affections."" “And yet,” said Lady Anne, “it is a danger to which they are much exposed in society. Men have it in their power to assume the appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable, and women have scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit."" “Without Ithuriel's spear, how can they distinguish the good from the evil ?"" said Belinda. “This is a commonplace complaint, I know; the ready excuse that we silly young women plead, when we make mistakes for which our friends reproach us, and for which we too often reproach ourselves.” “The complaint is commonplace precisely because it is general and just,” replied Lady Anne. “In the slight and frivolous intercourse, which fashionable belles usually have with those fashionable beaux who call themselves their lovers, it is surprising that they can discover any thing of each other's real character. Indeed they seldom do; and this probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy marriages.

In order that I might assist in working the vessel, the French prize-master—not my friend, who had returned to his ship—offered me my liberty, which I gladly accepted. No sooner were the captain and I together, and we saw that the 'Saint Louis' had parted company, than we began to plot means of recapturing the 'Euphemia.' It was a most hazardous, not to say harebrained, project, but this recommended it perhaps all the more to our attention. ""The firearms were kept on deck in racks round the masts; but we knew that the prize-master had stowed away, somewhere, two brace of pistols and a sword, and to obtain possession of these became our primary object. The magazine being, as is usual in this class of vessel, below the cabin floor, to which access was had through a hatch under the table, we anticipated little trouble in providing ammunition.  The Autobiography of a Man-o-War's Bell. 193 The great difficulty was to ascertain the exact position of the concealed arms. ""As it was manifest that the successful termination of the enterprise depended solely on the advantage taken of the first moments of panic, it was desirable that the enemy should have no time for consideration, and that the surprise should be complete. Fortunately, we could mature our plans with little chance of detection, as we knew only one man on board was conversant with English. Whil^ one of us during favourable opportunities searched for the hidden arms, another kept watch above without exciting observation. This was rendered easy in consequence of an opening over the cabin door, large enough for a person sitting on the lockers in the cabin to see the companion ladder; this opening had been made after the vessel was a prize, by a pet parrot, which had worked away with its bill, thus constituting itself a valuable auxiliary to its master's enemies. ""At length the arms were found concealed beneath the mattrass in the prize-master's bunk. They were taken possession of in the morning, and we then resolved to carry out our enterprise immediately, before their loss could be discovered. As the captain thought it better not to load all the pistols 13  194 The A utobiography of a Man-d- Wars Bell. with ball cartridge, one pistol of each brace was charged with slugs, made of a pair of pewter teaspoons, broken up hastily just when they were wanted. We each took a brace, intending to make use of the slug-loaded pistols first, and the others if absolutely required. After having loaded them and seen that they were in an efficient state, as far as we could without firing them off, the captain concealed them in the bed-clothes in his berth, which was on the starboard side of the cabin. Opposite him, on the port side, slept either the prize-master or his mate. The crew's"

From endeavouring to persuade, she descended to entreaties, pointed out the good that might be effected, by her coming to them, and added, that Letitia had an affection for Susan. “Why, my dear lady,” said the honest farmer, “how can that be? when they have never spoken to each other?” • Mrs. Fretwell said it was so, nevertheless, and moreover added, that she dared not take home a denial ; assuring them that if they would let their daughter come, it would be one of the best actions of their lives; for it would make a whole family happy. Had Mrs. Fretwell possessed either feeling or penetration, she would never Sed  FRETWELL HALL. 83 have carried her point; as she must have seen the strong repugnance these worthy people felt to part with their child. But she had attacked them in a vulnerable part; that of being able to do good. After some hesitation, and stipulating that Susan should pass the Sunday at home, they gave their consent. The lady having now gained her point, overwhelmed them with civilities, returned home in high spirits; and the following week, Susan Thresher was constituted an inmate at Fretwell Hall. The mild manners and cheerful disposition of Susan, joined to the novelty of having a young companion, had for a considerable time a wonderful effect on Letitia ; pride came to her aid, and she felt ashamed to expose herself before her new acquaintance. Mrs, Fretwell congratulated herself  .84 FRETWELL HALL. It daily on the success of her plan, which had answered even more than she could have expected. How little did farmer Thresher and his wife think, when they parted with their child, she would not again reside under their roof: 'tis true Mrs. Fretwell had not stipulated for any limited time; but the parents of Susan had, and greatly were they disappointed, when at the end of eight years, there was no more likelihood of their having their daughter home, than there had been at the end of one. Yes! eight years had passed, since Susan Thresher went to live at Fretwell Hall; and many were the changes which had taken place in that space of time. The gout had made great inroads on the constitution of Mr. Fretwell, he was grown morose and peevish, become an  FRETWELL HALL. 85 invalid, neglected in his family, and never having cultivated his mind, by reading or study, he had full leisure to think how little good he had done in the world. From leading an indolent and luxurious life, Mrs. Fretwell had become prematurely infirm, and ailing; she could no longer support the fatigue of company ; yet, such was the force of habit, the same routine of visiting and parties continued. Mischievous in infancy, turbulent in childhood, Letitia had grown up a perverse and fretful woman. A rainy day,

Yes! he, the stern Greville, — the estranged husband,— moved by the deep distress manifested in the appearance of his wife, acknowledged his sympathy by the first tears he had shed in her presence. ""This is a mere phantasm of the brain,"" said he at length, attempting to regain his composure; ""the coinage of a lively imagination, which loves to deceive itself by, But no,"" continued he, observing her incredulous and agonized expression of countenance, "" no! my Helen, I will not longer rack thy generous mind by these sufferings, however bitter the truth may be to utter or to hear.

Thou who hast accused me of insensibility to thy charms, and to thine endearing affection, judge of the strength of my love by the labyrinth of sin into which it hath betrayed me. Helen!, my wife still lives, and I am not thy lawful husband."" It was many hours before the unfortunate Lady Greville sufficiently recovered her composure to understand and feel the full extent of the fatal intelligence she had received, and the immediate bearing it must have upon her happiness, her rights, and those of her child. As by degrees the full measure of her misery unfolded to her comprehension, she fell into no paroxysm of angry grief, she vented her despair in no revilings against the guilty Greville. Sorrowfully, indeed, but calmly, she requested to be made acquainted with the whole extent of her miserable destiny. ""Let me know the worst,"" said she. ""I have been long, too long deceived; and the only mercy you can now bestow upon me is an unreserved and unqualified confidence."" But Lord Greville could not trust himself to make so painful a communication in words, and after passing the night in writing, he delivered to her the following relation :— LORD GREVILLE'S HISTORY. ""I need not dwell upon the occurrences of my childhood; I need not relate the events which rendered my youth equally eventful and distinguished. My early life was passed so entirely in the immediate service of my sovereign, and in participation of the troubles and dangers which disastrous times and a rebellious people heaped upon his head, that the tenor of my life has been as public as his own. ""Yet, forgive me, Helen, for saying that I cannot even now, in this my day of humiliation, but glory in the happy fortune which crowned with success my efforts in the royal cause, both in the field and in the cabinet, and won for me at once the affection of my king, and the approbation of Tny fellowcountrymen, when I remember that to these flattering testimonies I owe not only the friendship of your father, but the first affections of his child.

Two of the sailors secured ropes to a grating, and taking  STORIES OF OFFICERS OF CERVERA'S SQUADRON. 265 the other end of the ropes in their mouths swam to the shore towing the grating, the admiral bearing part of his weight on it. The admiral's son, one of his staff, swam along behind his father and assisted as best he could. Had it not been for this assistance Adiniral Cervera would undoubtedly have been drowned, as he is a very poor swimmer. While the men were in the water the Cubans on shore commenced firing at them until the 'Iowa' put a stop to that atrocity by throwing a shell among them and scattering them.” Captain Eulate, of the “Vizcaya,” speaking of the battle, said : “When the order to leave port was given we all realized that we were going out to meet disaster, and that we were being sacrificed on the altar of Spanish honor. My officers and men fought like true Spaniards to the end, but it was useless. I was fighting four ships, any one of which was superior to my own. My poor ‘Vizcaya,' she was a splendid ship, but now she is only a wreck. I have lost everything except honor.” Continuing he said : “When the 'Maria Teresa' headed for shore I passed her, and I had the ‘Brooklyn,' * Texas,' 'Iowa' and 'Oregon' all firing at me. The firing from these ships was terrific; shells were bursting all around us. My ship was set on fire by a shell exploding in iny cabin. My engines and pumps were disabled, and I could not fight the flames. My men were being killed and wounded in large numbers. A shell finally exploded in my forward magazines and I was forced to head for the shore. When I went into action, I had flying at my masthead a large embroidered silk fag, which had been made and presented to the ship by ladies of the province of Vizcaya. When I saw that my ship would be lost, I had this flag hauled down and burned, and hoisted another ensign in its place. My flag was shot away twice during the engagement, the last time just as the ship grounded. The boats of the 'Iowa' picked up those of my officers and men still left alive, carrying them to that ship. When I went on board the Iowa,' I took off my sword and tendered it to Captain Evans, but he refused it, saying that I had fought four ships and that I could keep my sword. That was the proudest moment of my life.” The captain of the “Oquendo” committed suicide and the second and third officers were killed during the the ""Oquendo's"" engagement.

It was not to be expected that, with the aid of such members of their fanily, domestics, or dependents, as might join them in any insurrection, they could do more than equip a few squadrons of horse; and even if they could have found men, they were generally deficient in arms, horses, and the means of taking the field. The Highland clans were in a different state; they were as much under the command of their superior chiefs and chieftains as ever they had been during the earlier part of their history; and, separated from civilization by the wildermesses in which they lived, they spoke the language, wore the dress, submitted to ine government, and wielded the arms of their fathers. It is true, that clan wars were not now practised on the former great scale, and that two or three small garrisons of soldiers quartered amongst them put some stop to their predatory incursions. The superior chieftains and tacksmen, more especially the duinhé-wassals, or dependent gentlemen of the tribe, were in no degree superior in knowledge to the common clansmen. The high chiefs, or heads of the considerable clans, were in a very different situation. They were almost all men of good education, and polite manners, and when in Lowland dress and lowland society, were scarce to be distinguished from other gentlemen, excepting by an assumption of consequence, the natural companion of conscious authority. They often travelled abroad, and sometimes entered the military service, looking always forward to the time when their swords should be required in the cause of the Stewarts, to whom they were in general extremely attached; though in the West Highlands the great influence of the Duke of Argyle, and in the North that of the Earl of Sutherland and Lord Reay, together with the chiefs of Grant, Ross, Munro, and other northern tribes, fixed their claus in the Whig interest. These chiefs were poor; for the produce of their extensive but barren domains was entirely consumed in supporting the military force of the clan, from whom no industry was to be expected, as it would have degraded them in their own eyes, and in those of their leaders, and rendered them unfit for the discharge of their warlike duties. The chiefs, at the same time, when out of the lighlands, were expensive as well as needy. The sense of self-importance, which we have already noticed, induced them to imitate the expenses of a richer country, and many, by this inconsistent conduct, exposed themselves to pecuniary distress.

Thanks to my stars, however, I had youth and novelty on my side : so the young ladies persisted in admiring my poetry in spite of Horace and illegitimacy. I consoled myself with the good opinion of the young ladies, whom I had always found to be the best judges of poetry. As to these old scholars, said I, they are apt to be chilled by being steeped in the cold fountains of the classics. Still I felt that I was losing ground, and that it was necessary to bring matters to a point. Just at this time there was a public ball, attended by the best society of the place, and by the gentry of the neighborhood : I took great pains with my toilet on the occasion, and I had never looked better. I had determined that night to make my grand assault on the heart of the young lady, to battle it with all my forces, and the next morning to demand a surrender in due form. I entered the ballroom amidst a buzz and flutter, which generally took place among the young ladies on my appearance. I was in fine spirits ; for, to tell the truth, I had exhilarated myself by a cheerful glass of wine on the occasion. I talked, and rattled, and said a thousand silly things, slap-dash, with all the confidence of a man sure of his auditors,—and every thing had its effect. In the midst of my triumph I observed a little knot gathering together in the upper part of the room. By degrees it increased. A tittering broke out here and there, and glances were cast round at me, and then there would be fresh tittering.

Astonished at the unparalleled beauty of this bird, the ancients could not help indulging their lively and creative fancy, in accounting for the magnificence of his plumage.  The Peacock. 305 feathers, each of which is composed of a slender stem and a small tnft at the top. Displayed with conscious pride, and exposed under a variety of angles to the reflections of light, the broad and variegated disks of his train, of which the neck, head, and breast of the bird become the centre, claim our admiration. By an extraordinary mixture of the brightest colours, it displays at once the richness of gold, and the paler tints of silver, fringed with bronze-coloured edges, and surrounding eye-like spots of dark brown and sapphire. The hen does not share in the beauty of the cock, and her feathers are generally of a light brown. She lays only a few eggs at a time, generally at an interval of three or four days; they are white and spotted, like the eggs of the turkey. She sits from twenty-seven to thirty days. The loud screamings of the Peacock are worse than the harsh oroakings of the raven, and a sure prognostic of bad weather; and his feet, more clumsy than those of the turkey, make a sad contrast with the elegance of his plumage: ""Though richest hues the Peacock's plumes adorn, Yet horror screams from his discordant throat."" The spreading of the train, the swelling of the throat, neck, and breast, and the puffing noise which they emit at certain times, are proofs that the Turkey and the Peacock stand nearly allied in the family chain of animated beings. The flesh of the Peacock was anciently esteemed a princely dish; and the whole bird used to be served on  306 Birds.

She even praised Catharine’s voice and, in the morning when she bade her “good-bye,” said: “You are a good singer ; well, then, be also a good girl.” But in spite of these words, Catharine did not feel that she had come any closer to her grandmother's heart or love. And without being at all envious or jealous, she could not help but notice how much more familiar and affectionate the old lady was with Gertrude and Alida — how much more interested in their life, their amusements, their friends and their dress. A polite inquiry about her mother's health was all the attention she gave to her daughter-in-law's affairs; and as to her business venture, she never named it. Perhaps Uncle Jacob also noticed this neglect of interest, for he paid Catharine much attention. He called for extra wraps in the sleigh, he troubled himself about her feet and her hands, and wondered if the little red hood she wore was warm enough to protect her ears. 141  Trinity Bells And all the way to the city he talked to her about her father, and did his best to comfort and to give her hope.

It has been somewhere said by Johnson, that merely to invent a story is no small effort of the human understanding. How much more difficult is it to construct stories suited to the early years of youth, and at the same time conformable to the complicate relations of modern society—fictions that shall display examples of virtue without initiating the young reader into the ways of vice—narratives written in a style level to his capacity without tedious detail or vulgar idiom! The author, sensible of these difficulties, solicits indulgence for such errors as have escaped her vigilance. In a former work the author has endeavoured to add something to the increasing stock of innocent amusement and early instruction which the laudable exertions of some excellent modern writers provide for the rising generation; and in the present an attempt is made to provide for young people of a more advanced age a few tales that shall neither dissipate the attention nor inflame the imagination. In a work upon education which the public has been pleased to notice, we have endeavoured to show that under proper management amusement and instruction may accompany each other through many paths of literature, while at the same time we have disclaimed and reprehended all attempts to teach in play.

But all this time Miss Turnbull has never married, though she has been so much in the great world, and from her large fortune must have had so many offers.

My nephew, who is so amiable and sensible, is just the man for her, and he had used to admire her very much in former times, when he met her at Elmour Grove."" Mrs. Wynne hinted her wishes to her nephew, but he seemed not much inclined towards Miss Turnbull, ""Because,"" said he, ""though Frederick and his sister never uttered a syllable to her disadvantage, I cannot, from circumstances, help imagining, that she has not behaved well to them; and besides, after five or six years spent in the great world, and in all the dissipation in which she has lived, her disposition cannot probably be the same as it was when I knew her in the country."" Mrs. Wynne could not, with her good-natured eyes, see the force of any of these objections, and she was determined to convince her nephew of their futility. With this view she formed a scheme which was to be kept a profound secret from the parties concerned, till the moment when it should be ripe for execution. She heard that Miss Turnbull was in want of a companion; and she knew that Mrs. Henry Elmour, a very amiable young widow, distantly related to the Elmour family, and who had formerly been a friend of Almeria's, was at this moment in great distress. She had no doubt that Miss Turnbull would be delighted with an opportunity of serving any one connected with a family to whom she owed such obligations. Mrs. Wynne fancied that this would be the finest occasion imaginable to prove to her nephew, that notwithstanding Almeria had lately lived so much in the fashionable world, she had the same grateful heart as formerly. Eager to come to this demonstration, Mrs. Wynne wrote immediately to the distressed widow, begging her to come to town with all possible expedition; ""for I have found, or at least I am morally Sure of finding, the most charming situation your heart can desire. I say no more, that I may not deprive you of the pleasure of the surprise."" The same day that she sent this letter to the post, she despatched the following note to Almeria: ""Mv dear Miss Turnbull, ""1 am too well persuaded of the goodness of your heart to fear that you should think my present interference impertinent.

Dr. B. now entered the room with little Oliver. When Holloway returned with Howard, he beheld the stagecoachman standing silent on one side of his father; Mr. Carat, the Jew, on the other side, jabbering an unintelligible vindication of himself; whilst Dr. B. was contemplating the box of lottery prizes, which lay open upon the table. Mr. Supine, leaning against the chimney-piece, appeared in the attitude of an Antinous in despair. ""Come, my little friend,"" said Dr. B. to Oliver, "" you did not put into the lottery, I understand. Choose from amongst these things whatever you please. It is better to trust to prudence than fortune, you see. Mr. Howard, I know that I am rewarding you, at this instant, in the manner you best like, and best deserve."" There was a large old-fashioned chased gold toothpick-case, on which Oliver immediately fixed his eye. After examining it very carefully, he drew the doctor aside, and, after some consultation, Oliver left the room hastily; whilst the alderman, with all the eloquence of which he was master, expressed his gratitude to Howard for the advice which he had given his son. ""Cultivate this young gentleman's friendship,"" added he, turning to Holloway: ""he has not a title; but even 7, Augustus, am now ready to acknowledge he is worth twenty Lord Rawsons. Had he a title, he would grace it; and that's as much its I can say for any man."" The Jew, all this time, stood in the greatest trepidation; he trembled lest the alderman should have him taken up and committed to gaol for his illegal, unlicensed lottery. He poured forth as many protestations as his knowledge of the English language could afford of the purity of his intentions; and, to demonstrate his disinterestedness, began to display the trinkets  THE GOOD AUNT. in hia prize-box, with a panegyric upon each. Dr. B. interrupted him, by paying for the toothpick-case, which he had bought for Oliver. ""Now, Mr. Carat,"" said the doctor, "" you will please to return, in the first place, the money you have received for your illegal lottery tickets."" The word illegal, pronounced in a tremendous tone, operated instantaneously upon the Jew; his hand, which had closed upon Holloway's guineas, opened; he laid the money down upon the table, but mechanically seized his box of trinkets, which he seemed to fear would be the next seized, as forfeits. No persons are so apprehensive of injustice and fraud as those who are themselves dishonest. Mr. Carat, bowing repeatedly to Alderman Holloway, shuffled toward the door, asking if he might now depart; when the door opened with such a force, as almost to push the retreating Jew upon his face.. Little Oliver, out of breath, burst into the room, whispered a few words to Dr. B. and Alderman Holloway, who answered, ""He may come in;"" and a tall, stout man, an officer from Bowstreet, immediately entered."

Belinda was silent; but, after a pause, she said, “That it was certainly very dangerous, especially for women, to trust to fancy in bestowing their affections.” “ And yet,” said Lady Anne, “it is a danger to which they are much exposed in society. Men have it in their power to assume the appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable, and women have scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit."" “Without Ithuriel's spear, how can they distinguish the good from the evil?"" said Belinda. “This is a common-place complaint, I know; the ready excuse that we silly young women plead, when we make mistakes for which our friends reproach us, and for which we too often reproach ourselves.” “The complaint is common-place precisely because it is general and just,” replied Lady Anne. “ In the slight and frivolous intercourse, which fashionable belles usually have with those fashionable beaux who call themselves their lovers, it is surprising that they can discover any thing of each other's real character. Indeed they seldom do ; and this probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy marriages. A woman who has an opportunity of seeing her lover in private society, in domestic life, has infinite advantages; for if she has any sense, and he has any sincerity, the real character of both may perhaps be developed.” "" True,"" said Belinda (who now suspected that Lady Anne alluded to Mr. Vincent); “and in such a situation a woman would readily be able to decide whether the man who addressed her would suit her taste or not; so she would be inex BELINDA. 233 cusable if, either from vanity or coquetry, she disguised her real sentiments.” “And will Miss Portman, who cannot, by any one to whom she is known, be suspected of vanity or coquetry, permit me to speak to her with the freedom of a friend ?” Belinda, touched by the kindness of Lady Anne's manner, pressed her hand, and exclaimed, “ Yes, dear Lady Anne, speak to me with freedom—you cannot do me a greater favour. No thought of my mind, no secret feeling of my heart, shall be concealed from you."" ""Do not imagine that I wish to encroach upon the generous openness of your temper,” said Lady Anne; ""tell me when I go too far, and I will be silent. One who, like Miss Portman, has lived in the world, has seen a variety of characters, and probably has had a variety of admirers, must have formed some determinate idea of the sort of companion that would make her happy, if she were to marry-unless,” said Lady Anne, “she has formed a resolution against marriage."" ""I have formed no such resolution,” said Belinda. “Indeed, since I have seen the happiness which you and Mr. Percival enjoy in your own family, I have been much more disposed"

She was a woman of an excellent heart, and absolutely incapable of suspecting that others could be less frank or friendly than herself. She was sometimes led into mistakes by this undistinguishing benevolence; for she imagined that all which appeared wrong would prove right, if properly understood; that there must be some good reason for every thing that seemed to be bad ; that every instance of unkindness or insolence was unde signed; and that every quarrel was only a misunderstanding. Possessed by this good-natured kind of wrong-headedness, she frequently did the most pro ALMERIA. 223 voking, by way of doing the most obliging things imaginable. Upon this principle she would place contending parties by surprise in the very situation which of all others they most wished to avoid, and then gave the signal for a pitched battle, by begging the enemies would shake hands with one another. Now she had heard it reported in Yorkshire that there was some coolness between the Elmours and Miss Turnbull; but she was morally certain there could be no truth in this report, for a variety of the very best reasons in the world. “In the first place,” argued Mrs. Wynne,“ to my certain knowledge, Miss Turnbull was, from her infancy, always the greatest favourite at Elmour Grove, the pupil of the good old gentleman, and the intimate friend of the daughter. During that odd Hodgkinson's lifetime, Almeria was always with Miss Ellen Elmour, who treated her quite like a sister. I am sure I remember, as if it was yesterday, her introducing Miss Turnbull to me, and the affectionate way in which she spoke of her; and I particularly recollect hearing Almeria Turnbull, among other grateful things, say, that she should wish to live and die with her friends at Elmour Grove. Then she had stronger reasons afterward for being attached to, them-you know it was Mr. Frederick Elmour who gained her large fortune for her. I was in the courthouse in York the very day the cause was decided, and I never heard a man speak with more energy and eloquence than Frederick Elmour did in her defence. It was plain, indeed, that the eloquence came from his heart; as to the law part of the business, I know my nephew, who understands those things, said it was a very nice question, and that if her cause had not been managed as ably as it was, she would not have gained her fortune. Now of course this was a thing that never could be forgotten. I own I expected that there would have been a match between Miss Turnbull and Mr. Elmour; but Sir Thomas Stock, her guardian, took her away from us, and Mr. Elmour fell in love with another lady. But all this time Miss Turnbull has never married, though she

Conrad, the son, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no promising disposition ; yet he was the darling of his father, who never showed any symptoms of affection to Matilda. Manfred had contracted a marriage for his son with the Marquis of Vicenza's daughter, Isabella ; and she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of Manfred, that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad's infirm state of health would permit. Manfred's impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbours. The former, indeed, apprehending the severity of their prince's disposition, did not dare to utter their sur. mises on this precipitation. Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady, did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early, considering his great youth, and greater infirmities; but she never received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility, who had given him but one heir. His tenants and subjects were less cautious in their discourses : they attributed this hasty wedding to the prince's dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy, which was said to have pronounced, that the castle and lordship of Otranto should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown  186 THE CASTLE OF OTRANTO : too large to inhabit it. It was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy; and still less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in question. Yet these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the populace adhere the less to their opinion. Young Conrad's birthday was fixed for his espousals. The company was assembled in the chapel of the castle, and every thing ready for beginning the divine office, when Conrad himself was missing. Manfred, impatient of the least delay, and who had not observed his son retire, despatched one of his attendants to summon the young prince. The servant, who had not stayed long enough to have crossed the court to Conrad's apartment, came running back breathless, in a frantic manner, his eyes staring, and foaming at the mouth. He said nothing, but pointed to the court. The company were struck with terror and amazement. The Princess Hippolita, without knowing what was the matter, but anxious for her son, swooned away. Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the procrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic, asked imperiously what was the matter? The fellow made no answer, but continued 'pointing towards the court-yard ; and, at last, after repeated questions put to him, cried out,“Oh! the helmet! the helmet!"" In the mean time, some of the company had run into the court, from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise. Manfred, who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went himself to get information of what occasioned this strange confusion. Matilda remained endeavouring to assist her mother, and Isabella stayed for the same purpose, and"

Prompted by such passions, and allured by such views, they concerted in private, and unknown even to the Marchese, the means of accomplishing their general end. Vivaldi, as he quitted his mother's closet, had met Schedoni in the corridor leading thither. He knew him to be her confessor, and was not much surprised to see him, though the hour was an unusual one. Schedoni bowed his head as he passed, and assumed a meek and holy countenance; but Vivaldi, as he eyed him with a penetrating glance, now recoiled with involuntary emotion; and it seemed as if a shuddering presentiment of what this monk was preparing for him had crossed his mind.  148 Anne Radcliffe XI. THE MARCHESA AND SCHEDONI ('THE ITALIAN ) The Marchesa repaired, according to her appointment, to the church of San Nicolo, and, ordering her servants to remain with the carriage at a side-door, entered the choir, attended only by her woman. When vespers had concluded, she lingered till nearly every person had quitted the choir, and then walked in the solitary aisles. Her heart was as heavy as her step; for when is it that peace and evil passions dwell together? As she slowly paced the transept, she perceived a monk passing between the pillars, near the cloisters, who, as he approached, lifted his cowl, and she knew him to be Schedoni. He instantly observed the agitation of her spirits, and that her purpose was not yet determined, according to his hope. But, though his mind became clouded, his countenance remained unaltered; it was grave and thoughtful. The sternness of his vulture-eye was, however, somewhat softened, and its lids were contracted by subtlety. The Marchesa bade her woman walk apart, while she conferred with her confessor. “This unhappy boy,' said she, when the attendant was at some distance, “how much suffering does his  The Marchesa and Schedoni 149 folly inflict upon his family!

The confessor bowed. “The Marchese is, no oubt, equally afflicted with yourself,' said he; but h e is, notwithstanding, much more competent to Radvise you on this delicate subject than I am.' 'The Marchese has prejudices, father, as you well know; he is a sensible man, but he is sometimes mistaken, and he is incorrigible in error. He has the faults of a mind that is merely well disposed ; he is destitute of the discernment and the energy which would make it great.

This done, they left the house, in different directions, having agreed to meet again, in an hour, at the King's Head public 1 12 CONGO IN SEARCH house, where an excellent supper was preparing for them.

The falsehood he had uttered lay heavy at his heart, and he tried in vain to forget it. O'Leary and his gang met at the King's Head. The best dishes of the season were set before them. They ate, drank, and caroused;—for some time, they endeavoured to make Congo king of the revel; they told marvellous and amusing stories of their own exploits, which were all intended to recommend their line of life to the young professor, as they called Congo; and they drank his health, and welcomed him among them, with three times three.

He had been brought up to detest the practice of drinking strong liquors, even in moderation; and this feeling, together with the hint he had received, gave him courage to resist all the intreaties of his companions, and, what was more difficult, all their jokes and sneers; so, abusing him as a sulky dog, they at last left him to his own reflections; and had they wished to punish him for his refusal to drink, they could not have done it more effectually. He retired to the foot of the table, and laying his head on his arms, he thought over the events of the last twenty-four hours, and shed silent tears of anguish and remorse. He compared his present feelings with those of the preceding evening: he had then thought himself as wretched as it was possible for him to be ; but he now felt how L 3  114 CONGO IN SEARCH much severer are the stings of a guilty conscience, than the most melancholy events in life: his sorrow for his master was sweet, in comparison with his present remorse.

Your mother, in her fear, wandered a hundred miles; and at last a good lord permitted her to rent the cottage where you were brought up, and where she supported you by the labour of her hands. It is to heal her many wrongs that I caused you to be tempted to exchange your valuable cow for a few trifling beans; and I caused that beanstalk to shoot up, so that you  200 JACK AND THE BEAN STALK. might find your way to the giant's home, and there punish him; for I tell you, you will neither be brave, rich, nor happy, till you have caused his death.

Bear this in mind,-so long as you obey my orders, I will watch over you, and keep you from any harm.” The fairy then vanished; and Jack, putting his best foot foremost, travelled till evening, when he came all at once in front of a noble mansion, the windows of which glimmered like fires in the red light of the sun’s setting. . A plain-looking old lady stood at the front door, and to her the lad addressed himself, asking only for a crust of bread and a bed for a single night. “Alas!” said she, “I could do no such a thing; for my husband is a fierce giant, who likes nothing so well as a taste of human flesh; and he is now hunting about to see if he can find some; and God help any one who falls in his way when he is so very hungry. In this house you would not be safe for a moment.” Jack was frightened at this word; but then he thought of the words of the fairy, who promised to protect him: so he begged the old lady to take him in, and hide him in any hole or corner; and at last she consented to give him a night's lodging. Through the hall they went, which was an amazing large hall, the walls of which were covered with swords and pikes, and battle-axes, the handles of which were as thick as any ordinary gate-posts; and they passed on through many handsome rooms till they reached a dark long gallery, very dimly lighted; and all along the walls of this gallery were strong iron gratings, which let air into so many dismal dungeons, from whence arose screams and sighs of unhappy creatures, who

Ostensibly, he was chatting with a member of the Lower House; absolutely, he was watching Alma with that look in his eyes, caused, I think, by a certain peculiarity of dropping the lashes over them when he was angry, which made me fancy he was not overpleased to see the men crowding round the little lady. ""He won't come and speak to me. Do go and ask him to come,"" whispered Alma, confidentially, to me.

He glanced towards her. “She is quite as well without any attention from me, considering the reports that have already risen concerning us, and she seems admirably amused as it is.” “Halloa! are we jealous?” “Jealous!

II radiant smile at his approach made Castleton sneer and poor Curly swear sotto voce under his moustaches. De Vigne, however, did not say much to her; he shook hands with her, said one or two things, and then talking with Tom Severn (whom Alma had attracted to her side) about the ties shot off at Hornsey Wood that morning, left the little lady so much to the other men, that though he was within a yard of her, she thought she preferred him in her studio at St. Crucis than in the crowded salons of that “set” of his in which she had wished to meet him. De Vigne talked to those about him, but he meanwhile watched her dancing, lightly and gracefully as a Spanish girl or an Eastern bayadère; watched her, the fact dawning on him, with a certain warning thrill, that she was not, after all, a little thing to laugh at, and play with, and pet innocently, as he did his spaniel, but a woman, as dangerous to men as she was attractive to them, who could no more be trifled with without the trifling falling back again upon the trifler than absinthe can be drunk like water, or opium eaten long without delirium. Certain jealousies surged up in his heart, certain embers that had slumbered long began to quicken into flame; the blood that he had tried to chill into ice-water rushed through his veins with something of its natural rapidity and fire.

Be in peace with many, nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand.” With what prudence does he caution us in the choice of our friends! And with what strokes of nature, I could almost say of humour, has he described the behaviour of a treacherous and selfinterested friend ! “If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first, and be not hasty to credit him: for some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble. And there is a friend who, being turned to enmity and strife, will discover thy reproach.” Again, “Some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction : but in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants. If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and hide himself from thy face.” What can be more strong and pointed than the following verse —“Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends."" In the next words he particularises one of those fruits of friendship which is described at length by the two famous authors above-mentioned, and falls into a general eulogium of friendship, which is very just as well as very sublime. “A faithful friend is a strong defence; and he that hath found such an ong nath  102 ESSAYS AND TALES. found a treasure. Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is unvaluable. A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him. Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright; for as he is, so shall his neighbour, that is his friend, be also.” I do not remember to have met with any saying that has pleased me more than that of a friend's being the medicine of life, to express the efficacy of friendship in healing the pains and anguish which naturally cleave to our existence in this world; and am wonderfully pleased with the turn in the last sentence, that a virtuous man shall as a blessing meet with a friend who is as virtuous as himself. There is another saying in the same author, which would have been very much admired in a heathen writer: ""Forsake not an old friend, for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old thou shalt drink it with pleasurə."" With what strength of allusion and force of thought has he described the breaches and violations of friendship!—“Whoso casteth a stone at the birds, frayeth them away; and he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship. Though thou drawest a sword at a friend, yet despair not, for there may be a returning to favour. If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not, for"

A large open boat was just about to leave the quay, bound for the little sea-port at Allonby, in Cumberland. In this vessel Brown embarked, and resolved to make that place his temporary abode, until he should receive letters and money from England. In the course of their short voyage he entered into some conversation with the steersman, who was also owner of the boat, a jolly old man, who had occasionally been engaged in the smuggling trade, like most fishers on the coast. After talking about objects of less interest, Brown endeavoured to turn the discourse toward the Mannering family. The sailor had heard of the attack upon the house at Woodbourne, but disapproved of the smugglers' proceedings. ""Hands off is fair play; zounds, they'll bring the whole country down upon tiiem—na, na ! when I was  GUY MANNERING. 183 in that way I played at giff-gaff with the officers—here a cargo taen—verra weel, that was their luck;—there another carried clean through, that was mine—na, na! hawks shouldna pike out hawks' een.""

""Troth, he's nae wise man neither, to interfere— no that I blame him for saving the gangers' lives—that was very right; but it wasna like a gentleman to be fighting about the poor folk's pocks o' tea and brandy kegs—however, he's a grand man and an officer man, and they do what they like wi' the like o' us."" ""And his daughter,"" said Brown, with a throbbing heart, ""is going to be married into a great family too, as I have heard?"" ""What, into the Hazlewoods'? Na, na, that's but idle clashes—every Sabbath day, as regularly as it came round, did the young man ride hame wi' the daughter of the late Ellangowan—and my daughter Peggy's in the service up at Woodbourne, and she says she's sure young Hazlewood thinks nae mair of Miss Mannering than you do."" Bitterly censuring his own precipitate adoption of a contrary belief, Brown yet heard with delight that the suspicions of Julia's fidelity, upon which he had so rashly acted, were probably void of foundation. How must he in the mean time be suffering in her opinion; or what could she suppose of conduct, which must have made him appear to her regardless alike of her peace of mind, and of the interests of their affection? The old man's connection with the family at Woodbourne seemed to offer a safe mode of communication, of which he determined to avail himself.

He told many most amusing stories, some of them about the negroes on his own plantation, and Mr. Lawford declared that he was much improved in storytelling, and that Agnes was not to be named with him. After this, Latimer rose to take his leave, nor could the old gentleman persuade him to stay until the ladies returned, although he promised that if he would, they would all go into the drawing-room, which was quite warm, and where was the piano, and Agnes should give him some of the finest music and songs that he had ever heard. But though Latimer declared that of all things he should like to hear Miss Agnes Lawford sing, yet he would not stay. “He is a wayward, perverse fellow !” said the old gentleman, when he was gone : “but, bless my soul! what a laugh we shall have against Mrs. Colville and the others.” CHAPTER XIII. Mr. Lawford had his laugh against his sister Colville the next day; but however annoyed that lady might in reality be, she had tact enough to let nothing of it be seen ; and the old gentleman was not sure whether, after all, he had had a triumph or not, more particularly as Mr. Latimer himself made an especial call that morning on the ladies of the family, which appeared greatly to satisfy them, and which occurring whilst he was out in his bath chair, and Agnes was in her own chamber, neither one or the other had any part in. Agnes was writing to Jeffkins; it was a difficult task to her, and while thus doing, very soon after Latimer had taken his departure, the door of the dressing-room, which divided her chamber from her cousin's, was suddenly opened, and Ada looking in, said in her occasionally abrupt manner, but with an expression of affectionate tenderness in her countenance, “May I come in 1 or rather,” added she, again withdrawing, “will you come in here 4” Agnes, very much astonished, hastily put aside her writing, and entered the room, which was rather a boudoir than dressing-room. Ada seated herself on a sofa, before which stood a writing-table, and motioned to Agnes to do the Saline. “No doubt, Agnes,” she said, “my conduct at this moment appears very extraordinary ; but I think I can make it intelligible to you. I know, at all events, that my coldness and reserve—the little sympathy and interest I for a long time felt towards you, must have wounded you, and must have given you a very unfavorable idea of my character: but I can explain the cause of this—I had strong prejudices against you.” “Against me !” interrupted Agnes. “Yes; I believed myself to have been unkindly treated by you.

The Lady of the Lake managed to get over the bar without damage, though she shipped a good deal of  UP THE HALYCAULA RIVER 211 water, and once she bumped, but not heavily; after two hours' further steaming she arrived off Baroon. However warlike the state of the country might have been, nothing could surpass the beauty and peacefulness of the scene surrounding this small settlement. Two branches of the river met here, and, on the point of land contained between them, Baroon stood. The Halychula is very meandering for its whole course, and, as it widened out at the junction of these branches, and the direct streams were lost sight of as they curved round the land, it gave the appearance of a large lake. Mangrove bushes fringed the shores and grew down to the water's edge, except on the point at Baroon, which, being subject to floods in the rainy season, had more than once been swept clear; and here enormous reeds and bulrushes grew from eight to ten feet high, about which butterflies and dragonflies of the richest and brightest hues incessantly played, glinting like precious stones in the sunlight. A little distance inland, huge cotton trees stretched fully three hundred feet towards heaven; their stems measuring twenty feet through at the base, but increased threefold by the parasitical creepers which formed enormous buttresses projecting from the parent stem as much as thirty feet. A large store-house, surrounded by a strong stockade, stood on slightly higher ground near the shore, and around this were some half-dozen smaller houses, built very much on the pattern of Swiss châlets, with steep-pitched shingled roofs, verandahs, and balconies, and covered with luxuriant creepers and exquisite flowers. These were owned by the European traders. The native village was a quarter of a mile distant, erected round an enormous banyan tree, which covered several hundreds of square yards of ground, and under its brauches the market was held and the principal trading done. P 2  212 DERELICT Running out from the shore, near the stockade, was a strong wooden pier, alongside of which small vessels could lie to discharge or take in their cargo. As the Lady of the Lake appeared off The Point, hundreds of natives rushed down to the shore cheering and gesticulating wildly. Flags were hoisted at all the European houses, from the balconies of which ladies waved handkerchiefs, talking excitedly and rather hysterically. There had been an anxious tine at Baroon lately. Since the letter had been sent to the Governor, which had taken four days to deliver and another day for the relief to arrive, Himana had become much more active. He had attacked several isolated factories along the river, and had stolen everything they contained. The Europeans had managed to escape by boat, and had not been very hotly pursued, as robbery seemed the chief object of

The Sunday following it rained, and the Sunday after that there was an east wind, so we saw nothing of the governess and her pupils for three weeks, when they appeared once more, in the middle of the evening service.

Lent was by this time nearly over, and we had entered upon the most solemn week of the Church's year. Perhaps (with the exception of the almost universal neglect of Ascension-day, which, in an age that affects peculiar reverence to the Saviour, is a fact altogether inexplicable, unless upon the supposition that that reverence consists in word rather than in deed, -since there is no reason why the festival of our Lord's ascension should be less honoured than that of his nativity),—perhaps with the exception just alluded to, there can be no more signal and painful instance of the carelessness in spiritual matters which marked the last age, than the almost universal closing of our churches --at any rate those in the rural districts—during the holy week. I can understand how those who never fast, and who do not think (as our Church does) that it is “ much to be wished” that the “ godly discipline” of primitive times should be restored again, set no store by Lent, and count it no privilege, or source of thankfulness, that a season has been set apart for them, wherein they may retire from the world, and give themselves up to offices of humiliation and prayer. It is intelligible that persons who are disposed to set their own judgments above that of the Church should allow what they look upon as an  CH.

It is intelligible, though it is hard to say how people can persuade themselves that they can despise the Church, without, at the same time, despizing the Church's Head. But where Passion-week is not observed, the neglect can hardly fail to arise not only from indifference to the privileges which the Church offers, but frorn deadness to religion, and low views of what has been achieved for

THE MINER'S RIGHT I had crossed more than one crest of the slate-strewn ranges, and was threading the close shrubbery of a narrow grassy dell, when I saw the woman whom we knew as Dolores coming along the track. Bareheaded, with rapid pace and eager gesture, she turned at once towards me as her eyes lighted on my approaching figure. Her head was thrown back ; her black hair, which was loose, fell in great masses down her back. Her eyes were flashing, and her white even teeth were set closely with a resolved, almost cruel expression. I thought of passing her without appearing to take notice of her altered mein, but dismissed the idea as I marked her evident distress and agitation. 'Good evening, Mrs. Malgrade,' I said ; 'what's wrong with you? Has anything happened ?'"" 'Happened?' she said, with fierce hate and scorn filling every line of her features, and blazing in her large dark eyes that seemed aglow with unearthly light. ""What should happen to a woman that's bound to Algernon Malgrade but wrong and ill-treatment. What have you to say of a man that strikes, that beats his wife. God help me! I am not THAT, but the miserable woman that bears his name; and here I swear before God that I will never do so more, or break bread, or live under the same roof with him, if I starve or work my fingers to the bone for it.' Here the excited woman fell upon her knees and raised her hands and face to heaven. 'I swear that I, Dolores Lusada, will never more live under the same roof with Algernon Malgrade, or take a morsel of meat or a piece of money from his hand, if I should starve; and if I do not keep this oath may my brain wither and this hand rot to the shoulder. Look here, Harry,' said she, 'do you see the pretty mark ?' here I saw that her face was bruised and cut as with a heavy blow. 'And see here,' she pulled up her sleeve, and on her white round arm was another livid mark that no light stroke ever made. 'And now you despise me. I know you do. Oh, Lord God! that ever I should have come to this ! Then she threw herself upon the green"

Down we went in most imposing form, slow and silent, all incipient cheers and cries being checked at once by a look from the chiefs. Our opponents were the reverse of classic in their array. Clamour, tumult, independence of throat and action, characterised their rabble rout. They were all stripped to their shirts, were bare-headed, had handkerchiefs or bands braced round their waists, and some of them were rolling earth or grass betwixt their palms and fingers, under the idea that this gave greater tenacity to the clench of the fist. They, like ourselves, had their champions, who stood in front swaying their bared arms, and shouting out challenges for some one from our ranks to come out and exchange a blow. The most vociferous of these was the son of a small farmer, a big uncouth fellow, bulky and largelimbed, but awkward and ungainly, shuffling in his movements, and loose in his strength. As this Goliath vaunted and defied us, the phalanx advanced, and our captain, who was at the apex, stood face to face with him. Shorter and less bulky than his antagonist, he was more compact, more firmly knit, more sinewy, and more elastic; and the round smooth face, ruddy and glowing, shaded by short dark curls, and the bright brown eye, usually laughing and gladsome, but now look 8 TALES FROM ""BLACKWOOD.” ing forth calm and steady, were a contrast to the coarse massive features which now grinned and scowled defiance at him. Blows were exchanged and parried, and the fight was begun. As the phalanx swayed onwards, the town boys swarmed round, and it broke out in all parts. There was one lad, the champion of the junior classes and smaller boys—a daring reckless fellow, all dash and spring — to whom fighting was mirth and pastime, and ever and anon he would spring out on some foe, bound round in a series of attacks, finish the combat in a few rounds, or leave it unfinished, dashing on in the mêlée, giving a black eye here, a bloody nose there, knocking out the tooth of one, or tripping up the heels of another, and ever accompanying his blows with gibe and taunt after the Homeric fashion, but rather more in the Swiveller style as to elocution. Thus the fight went on for an hour or more. Our foes were hard, lusty, and plucky; but blood and bone and compactness began at last to tell. Our tactics were not to advance beyond our own line. Against this front the town boys still advanced, but every time with more clamour and less effect, and every time the tide of attack ebbed backwards. Their champion, with two black eyes"

The only remedy was, to light large fires to windward of the barracks, and so to fill the rooms with smoke; but the remedy was almost as bad as the disease. Colonel Raymond, on hearing of Sergeant Porter's death, had written to Captain Seymour, authorizing him to select any sergeant he pleased out of the wing which was in Guiana, to succeed him in the colours and payment of the company; and Captain Seymour, who had long had his eyes upon Reynolds, who from the first had belonged to his company, did not hesitate for a moment to appoint him. Sergeant Porter had been very attentive to his duties, and his Captain had had no cause to find fault with him; but still his management of the company had been very different from that of Sergeant Lovell; and Captain Seymoul felt convinced that Reynolds, though so young, would be much more like what his old paysergeant had been. Reynolds could scarcely realise to himself that he had actually attained that step, which, from the time of his first joining his regiment at Newry, had been the highest object of his ambition. So far had he been from contemplating at the time the possibility of so rapid an advancement, that his utmost  THE WEST INDIES. 239 hope and wish was, that at the close of his twenty-one years' service he might stand in the same position as Sergeant Lovell; whereas now he found himself, at the end of five years, in possession of the colours and payment of a company. All that was wanting now to F. im in the same position as Sergeant ovell was the medal; but that was to be earned only by length of service, combined, I need scarcely add, with undeviating good conduct. Reynolds's was not an unusual case. There are, perhaps, few regiments in the service in which similar instances may not be found; and I doubt whether any young soldier of average talent ever failed to win his way rapidly, if he bent his mind in earnest to deserve promotion. There was, however, one man in No. 4 company, to whom Reynolds's promotion might have been expected to be unwelcome, and this was Sergeant Simmons, who, as we may remember, was already a sergeant in the company when Reynolds rejoined it at Gibraltar as a lance-sergeant. Sergeant Simmons was also ""...i. for the payment of a company; his conduct was unexceptionable; and, having been employed for some years in the orderly room, he was an excellent penman and accountant.

She used him, by degrees, worse and worse, until Duck convinced himself he was bound in justice to them feelings he had of his own, to turn upon her, when he could slyly, and annoy her as often as an opportunity for doing so, without danger, occurred.

The deep blue sky was changed to dusky red, And fierce destruction, like a whirlwind, came, Making the air one sheet of vivid flame; An army and a navy on each hand,* Launch all the terrors that fell war can frame * On the day of the grand attack made on Gibraltar, the 13th of September, 1782, by the combined French and Spanish forces, under the Duc de Crillon, the fortress was furiously assaulted simultaneously by land and sea.

About half-a-mile in rear of the house was a turnpike-road leading from the neighbouring vill of Lidbrook to the town of Ross, which latter might be from four to five miles distant. With this road a communication was effected by means of a deep, narrow lane, shaded by hazel trees, extending up to a gate-way placed towards the centre of the wall on the left of the little domain, and from which a carriage-drive, passing through the orchards on that side, led directly up to the house. Judging by the low arched portico which projected from the side of the building, the diamond panes and deep mouldings of the upper windows (the lower ones had been modernized so as to open out upon the lawn), the fantastic shape of the chimneys, and the gable ends above, the house had probably been constructed about two centuries back, and might have been the residence of one of that class of the landed gentry of moderate fortune, which was more numerous at that period in England than it has been in our times.

He was speedily introduced into the chamber, and, having made his bargain, duly detailed his intelligence. By listening at doors, and piecing out his imperfect information by neglected scraps of paper, he had, among other things, arrived at the knowledge that there was a new claimant for the Garretstown estates. It is unnecessary to go through the interview in which this information was communicated in all its details. Neville was satisfied of its importance, and acknowledged the justice of Purcel’s claim to be released. . “It is best,” said he, “that nothing be said about this.

To this remonstrance the King replied by a positive order, that the Scottish army should advance into England. This little army might consist of six or seven thousand excellent troops, commanded by James Douglas, brother to the Duke of Queensberry, as General-in-chief, and by the more celebrated John Grahain of Claverhouse, recently created Viscount of Dundee, as Major General. The former was secretly a favourer of the Prince of Orange's enterprise. Viscount Dundee, on the other hand, was devotedly attached to the cause of King James, and redeemed some of his fiercer and more cruel pro 156 PROCEEDINGS OF THE pensities, by the virtue of attaching himself to his benefactor, when he was forsaken by all the world besides. It is said, that the march was protracted by Douglas, lest the steadiness of the Scottish army should have served as an example to the English. At length, however, they reached London, where the Viscount of Dundee claimed a right to command, as eldest Major General; but the English officers of the same rank, whether out of national jealousy, or that Dundee's obtaining so high a rank might have interfered with their private schemes, positively refused to serve under him. . It is said, that, in the event of his obtaining this command, his design was to assemble such English troops as yet remained faithful, and, at the head of these and the Scottish army, to have marched against the Prince of Orange, and given him battle. But this scheme, which must have cost much bloodshed, was defeated by the refusal of the English officers to fight under him. King James, amidst the distraction of his affairs, requested the advice of this sagacious and determined adherent, who pointed out to him three courses. Thế first was, to try the fate of war, by manfully fighting the Prince of Orange. The second alternative was, to meet him in friendship, and require to know his purpose. The third was, to retire into Scotland, under protection of the little army of that kingdom. The King, it is said, was inclined to try the third alternative, but, as he received intelli VISCOUNT OF DUNDEE. 157 gence that several Scottish peers and gentle men were come post to London, to wait on the Prince of Orange, he justly doubted whether that kingdom would have proved a safe place of refuge. Indeed, he presently afterwards heard, that one of Douglas's battalions had caught the spirit of desertion, and gone over to the Prince. Shortly after this untoward event, Dundee, with such of his principal officers as adhered to the cause of James, received assurances of the King's disposition to hazard battle, and were commanded to meet him at Uxbridge, to consult upon the movements to be adopted.

But in the meantime it was clear that honest Briggs must not lose her chance of settlement for life; and so she and her bags were packed, and she set off on her journey. And so two of Rawdon's out-sentinels were in the hands of the enemy. Sir Pitt went and expostulated with his sister-in-law upon the subject of the dismissal of Briggs, and other matters of delicate family interest. In vain she pointed out to him how necessary was the protection of Lord Steyne for her poor husband; how cruel it would be on their part to deprive Briggs of the position offered to her. Cajolements, coaxings, smiles, tears could not satisfy Sir Pitt, and he had something very like a quarrel with his once admired Becky. He spoke of the honour of the family : the unsullied reputation of the Crawleys ; expressed himself in indignant tones about her receiving those young Frenchmen—those wild young men of fashion, my Lord Steyne himself, whose carriage was always at her door, who passed hours daily in her company, and whose constant presence made the world talk about her. As the head of the house he implored her to be more prudent. Society was already speaking lightly of her. Lord Steyne, though a nobleman of the greatest station and talents, was a man whose attentions would compromise any woman; he besought, he implored, he commanded his sister-in-law to be watchful in her intercourse with that nobleman. Becky promised anything and everything Pitt wanted; but Lord Steyne came to her house as often as ever, and Sir Pitt's anger increased. I wonder was Lady Jane angry or pleased that her husband at last found fault with his favourite Rebecca ? Lord Steyne's visits continuing, his own ceased ; and his wife was for refusing all futher intercourse with that nobleman, and declining the invitation to the Charade-night which the Marchioness sent to her; but Sir Pitt thought it was necessary to accept it, as his Royal Highness would be there.

Y.,  202 CRITICAL REVIEIVS. JACK STRAW's Castle, HAMPSTEAD: May 25. This is written in the midst of a general desolation and discouragement of the honest practitioners who dwell in the dingy first-floors about Middlesex Hospital and Soho. The long-haired ones are tearing their lanky locks; the velvet-coated sons of genius are plunged in despair ; the law has ordered the suppression of Art-Unions, and the wheel of Fortune has suddenly and cruelly been made to stand still. When the dreadful news came that the kindly harmless Artlottery was to be put an end to, although Derby-lotteries are advertised in every gin-shop in London, and every ruffian in the City may gamble at his leisure, the men of the brush and palette convoked a tumultuous meeting, where, amidst tears, shrieks, and wrath, the cruelty of their case was debated. Wyse of Waterford calmly presided over the stormy bladder-squeezers, the insulted wielders of the knife and maulstick. Wyse soothed their angry spirits with words of wisdom and hope. He stood up in the assembly of the legislators of the land and pointed out their wrongs. The painters' friend, the kind old Lansdowne, lifted up his cordial voice among the peers of Eng. land, and asked for protection for the children of Raphael and Apelles. No one said nay. All pitied the misfortune of the painters; · even Lord Brougham was stilled into compassion, and the voice of Vaux was only heard in sobs. These are days of darkness, but there is hope in the vista ; the lottery-subscription lies in limbo, but it shall be released therefrom and flourish, exuberantly revivified, in future years. Had the ruin been consummated, this hand should have withered rather than have attempted to inscribe jokes concerning it. No, Fraser is the artists' friend, their mild parent. While his Royal Highness Prince Albert dines with the Academicians, the rest of painters, less fortunate, are patronised by her Majesty REGINA. Yes, in spite of the Art-Union accident, there is hope for the painters. Sir Martin Archer Shee thinks that the Prince's condescension in dining with the Academy will do incalculable benefit to the art. Henceforth its position is assured in the world. This august patronage, the President says, evincing the sympathy of the higher classes, must awaken the interest of the low : and the public (the ignorant rogues !) will thus learn to appreciate what they have not cared for hitherto.

Was it my business to applaud or rebuke him for being humbleminded, or was I called upon to advise at all? My amiable reader,  174 THE ADVENTURES OF PHILIP acknowledge that you and I in life pretty much go our own way. We eat the dishes we like because we like them, not because our neighbour relishes them. We rise early, or sit up late ; we work, idle, smoke, or what not, because we choose so to do, not because the doctor orders. Philip, then, was like you and me, who will have our own way when we can. Will we not? If you won't, you do not deserve it. Instead of hungering after a stalled ox, he was accustoming himself to be content with a dinner of herbs. Instead of braving the tempest, he chose to take in sail, creep along shore, and wait for calmer weather. So, on Tuesday of every week let us say, it was this modest subeditor's duty to begin snipping and pasting paragraphs for the ensuing Saturday's issue. He cut down the parliamentary speeches, giving due favouritism to the orators of the Pall Mall Gazette party, and meagre outlines of their opponent's discourses. If the leading public men on the side of the Pall Mall Gazette gave entertainments, you may be sure they were duly chronicled in the fashionable intelligence; if one of their party wrote a book it was pretty sure to get praise from the critic. I am speaking of simple old days, you understand. Of course there is no puffing, or jobbing, or false praise, or unfair censure now. Every critic knows what he is writing about, and writes with no aim but to tell truth. Thus Philip, the dandy of two years back, was content to wear the shabbiest old coat; Philip, the Philippus of one-and-twenty, who rode showy horses, and rejoiced to display his horse and person in the park, now humbly took his place in an omnibus, and only on occasions indulged in a cab. From the roof of the larger vehicle he would salute his friends with perfect affability, and stare down on his aunt as she passed in her barouche. He never could be quite made to acknowledge that she purposely would not see him ; or he would attribute her blindness to the quarrel which they had had, not to his poverty and present position. As for his cousin Ringwood, “That fellow would commit any baseness,” Philip acknowledged ; “and it is I who have cut him,"" our friend averred. A real danger was lest our friend should in his poverty become more haughty and insolent than he had been in his days of better fortune, and that he should make companions of men who were not his equals. Whether was it better for him to be slighted in a fashionable club, or to swagger at the head of the company in a tavern "

The next winter, which you will probably spend in town, will give you opportunities of making a more prudent choice.” What Sophia's reflections were upon this occasion, I cannot pretend to determine: but I was not displeased, at the bottom, that we were rid of a guest from whom I had much to fear. Our breach of hospitality went to my conscience a little; but I quickly silenced that monitor by two or three specious reasons, which served to satisfy and reconcile me to myself. The pain which conscience gives the man who has already done wrong is soon got over. Conscience is a coward; and those faults it has not strength to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to accuse.  THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 97 CHAP. XIV.-Fresh mortifications, or a demonstration that seem·ing calamities may be real blessings. The journey of my daughters to town was now resolved upon, Mr Thornhill having kindly promised to inspect their conduct himself, and inform us by letter of their behaviour; but it was thought indispensably necessary that their appearance should equal the greatness of their expectations, which could not be done without expense. We debated, therefore, in full council, what were the easiest methods of raising money; or, more properly speaking, what we could most conveniently sell. The deliberation was soon finished: it was found that our remaining horse was utterly useless for the plough, without his companion; and equally unfit for the road, as wanting an eye: it was therefore determined that we should dispose of him, for the purpose above mentioned, at the neighbouring fair; and, to prevent imposition, that I should go with him myself. Though this was one of the first mercantile transactions of my life, yet I had no doubt of acquitting myself with reputation. The opinion a man forms of his own prudence is measured by that of the company he keeps; and as mine was mostly in the family way, I had conceived no unfavourable sentiments of my worldly wisdom. My wife, however, next morning, at parting, after I had got some paces from the door, called me back, to advise me, in a whisper, to have all my eyes about me. I had, in the usual forms, when I came to the fair, put my horse through all his paces, but for some time  98 THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. had no bidders. At last a chapman approached, and, after he had for a good while examined the horse round, finding him blind of one eye, he would have nothing to say to him; a second came up, but, observing he had a spavin, declared he would not take him for the driving home; a third perceived he had a windgall, and would bid no money; a fourth knew by his eye that he had the bots; a fifth wondered what a plague I could do at the fair with a blind, spavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be

The Greeks gave a wreath of laurels to the victor in the Pythian games, but the victor in the Olympic games had a wreath of wild olives, the victor in the Neme'an games a wreath of green parsley, and the victor in the Isthmian games a wreath of dry parsley or green pine-leaves. (Sec CROWN.) Laurel. The ancients believed that laurel communicated the spirit of prophecy and poetry. Hence the custom  Laurence 734 Law of crowning the pythoness and poets, and of putting laurel leaves under one's pillow to acquire inspiration. Another superstition was that the bay laurel was antagonistic to the stroke of lightning; but Sir Thomas Browne, in his Vulgar Errors, tells us that Vicomereatus proves from personal knowledge that this is by no means true. Laurel, in modern times, is a symbol of victory and peace. St. Gudule, in Christian art, carries a laurel crown. Laurence (Friar). The Franciscan friar who undertakes to marry Romeo and Juliet. To save Juliet from a second marriage he gives her a sleeping draught, and she is carried to the family vault as dead.

Lavalette (Marquis de), à French statesman who was condemned to death for sending secret despatches to Napoleon, was set at liberty by his wife, who took his place in the prison. Lord Nithsdale escaped in a similar way from the Tower of London. His wife disguised him as her maid, and with her he passed the sentries and made good his escape. Lavender.

Almost a week had elapsed ; noble lords and right honourable gentlemen were calling on Sir Robert every morning, according to the newspapers, but no one could hear from any authority of any appointment being really made. At last, there was a whisper very late one night at Crockford's, which was always better informed on these matters than the political clubs, and people looked amazed, and stared incredulously in each other's face. But it was true; there was a hitch, and in fourand-twenty hours the cause of the hitch was known. It seemed that the ministry really had resigned, but Berengaria, Countess of Montfort, had not followed their example. What a dangerous woman ! even wicked ! Zenobia was for sending her to the Tower at once. It was clearly impossible, she declared, 'for Sir Robert to carry on affairs with such a Duchesse de Longueville always at the ear of our young Queen, under the pretence forsooth of being the friend of Her Majesty's youth.' This was the famous Bed-Chamber Plot, in which the Conservative leaders, as is now generally admitted, were decidedly in error, and which terminated in the return of the Whigs to office. *But we must reconstruct,' said Lady Montfort to the prime minister. 'Sidney Wilton must be Secretary of State And  2;6 ENDYMION. you,' she said to Endymion, when she communicated to him the successful result of her interference, you will go with him. It is a great thing at your age to be private secretary to a Secretary of State.' CHAPTER LIX. MONTFORT CASTLE was the stronghold of England against the Scotch invader. It stood on a high and vast table-land, with the town of Montfort on one side at its feet, and on the other a wide-spreading and sylvan domain, herded with deer of various races, and terminating in pine forests; beyond them moors and mountains. The donjon keep, tall and grey, that had arrested the Douglas, still remained intact, and many an ancient battlement; but the long list of the Lords of Montfort had successively added to the great structure according to the genius of the times, so that still with the external appearance generally of a feudal castle, it combined in its various courts and quadrangles all the splendour and convenience of a modern palace. But though it had witnessed many scenes and sights, and as strange ones as any old walls in this ancient land, it may be doubted whether the keep of Montfort ever looked down on anything more rare than the life that was gathering and disporting itself in its towers and halls, and courts and parks, and forest chase, in the memorable autumn of this year. Berengaria had repaired to her castle full of triumph; her lord, in high good humour, admiring his wife for her energy, yet with a playful malice apparently enjoying the opportunity of showing that the chronology of her arrangements was confused, and her costume incorrect.

So she peered, and watched, and waited, like a Grey Musketeer skirmishing. Madame de Parabére, observing the Regent's attention engaged elsewhere, whispered something to George, looking insolently the while at his companion, and laughed., Then the Marquise primed her weapon, as it were, and shook the powder well up in the pan. A leaf of the rare bouquet peeped from under its covering. Madame de Parabére, flirting and ogling outrageously, as was her custom, whispered again in Captain George's ear, with a little affected laugh. It seemed to the eager watcher that her lips shaped the hated syllables — “Mulatto.” It was time to take aim now, sure and deadly, preparatory to giving fire. A cluster of stephanotis showed out like ivory against the smooth black satin. Madame de Parabére clapped her hands and exclaimed with a child's glee: “But, madame, what a bouquet! Madame is indeed fortunate! Such flowers are not to be procured within leagues of Paris. How exquisite! How ravishing! Madame is so good.  166 CERISE. Madame will permit me to have one little breath of their fragrance. Only one!"". The Marquise hesitated. An instinct of womanly forbearance prompted mercy even to another woman. Vindictive as she felt, and with her finger on the trigger, she would yet spare her, she thought; but the insolent creature should know her enemy, and should be taught that even the Regent's favourite could not command such bouquets as the acknowledged beauty of the Court. “They were sent me as a gift, madame,"" she obsérved haughtily, and withholding the flowers. I value them because ours are not yet blown at the Hôtel Montmirail."" “Pardon madame !"" retorted the other, unable, now that she knew her, to forego this opening for a thrust. “Tropical, of course! From an admirer, madame ? or perhaps a kinsman ? Very dark, no doubt, and with close curled hair. I offer you my compliments from the bottom of my heart !"" No quarter now. She had rushed upon her fate, and must be shot down without the least compunction. “If madame will deign to accept my bouquet,"" said the Marquise, “she will do me the highest honour."" And she displayed the whole of it, a wonder of nature, brought to perfection by art. Madame de Parabére, giddy, thoughtless, fond of flowers, stretched her hand out eagerly, and Captain George, whose attention the Regent's conversation had diverted from this passage of arms between the ladies, turned round while she was in the act of putting them enthusiastically to her face.

Down we went in most imposing form, slow and silent, all incipient cheers and cries being checked at once by a look from the chiefs. Our opponents were the reverse of classic in their array. Clamour, tumult, independence of throat and action, characterised their rabble rout. They were all stripped to their shirts, were bare-headed, had handkerchiefs or bands braced round their waists, and some of them were rolling earth or grass betwixt their palms and fingers, under the idea that this gave greater tenacity to the clench of the fist. They, like ourselves, had their champions, who stood in front swaying their bared arms, and shouting out challenges for some one from our ranks to come out and exchange a blow. The most vociferous of these was the son of a small farmer, a big uncouth fellow, bulky and largelimbed, but awkward and ungainly, shuffling in his movements, and loose in his strength. As this Goliath vaunted and defied us, the phalanx advanced, and our captain, who was at the apex, stood face to face with him. Shorter and less bulky than his antagonist, he was more compact, more firmly knit, more sinewy, and more elastic ; and the round smooth face, ruddy and glowing, shaded by short dark curls, and the bright brown eye, usually laughing and gladsome, but now look 8 TALES FROM ""BLACKWOOD.” ing forth calm and steady, were a contrast to the coarse massive features which now grinned and scowled defiance at him. Blows were exchanged and parried, and the fight was begun. As the phalanx swayed onwards, the town boys swarmed round, and it broke out in all parts. There was one lad, the champion of the junior classes and smaller boys—a daring reckless fellow, all dash and spring — to whom fighting was mirth and pastime, and ever and anon he would spring out on some foe, bound round in a series of attacks, finish the combat in a few rounds, or leave it unfinished, dashing on in the mêlée, giving a black eye here, a bloody nose there, knocking out the tooth of one, or tripping up the heels of another, and ever accompanying his blows with gibe and taunt after the Homeric fashion, but rather more in the Swiveller style as to elocution. Thus the fight went on for an hour or more. Our foes were hard, lusty, and plucky; but blood and bone and compactness began at last to tell. Our tactics were not to advance beyond our own line. Against this front the town boys still advanced, but every time with more clamour and less effect, and every time the tide of attack ebbed backwards. Their champion, with two black eyes and"

She's forty-nine years of age, come Candlemas; but does not keep the house so clane as she might: —but then, to be sure, there's the pigs— Now for Pat:—he's bow-legged,—which comes, as his wife, who admires him, says, from his riding so much to and fro across the panniers on his garron to market and back: but some think he was so from a boy,—still that doesn't matter;—his legs are quite good enough for every-day work, and nature wouldn't be wise to give holiday limbs to a higgler—would she now? Pat's forefathers must have been from beyond-sea parts, I think; or how would he have such a pale face, and large dull black eyes, without one feature, barring the cocked nose, of us raal ould Irish? If he was a fisherman, may be, he'd get a colour; but, as it is, though he never knows a day's sickness, he's as pale as a white night-cap; and his big eye looks like a piece of sea-coal in milk, or a town chimney-sweep in a snow-storm.  246 UNDER THE THUMB. Pat seems so innocent, that many suspect him to be a rogue,— a little sly, or that way inclined;—but Pat says no, and so does Mistress Doolan, and that's something. People tell how much some men and their wives are alike,—faith! so much, as often to be taken for brother and sister; and its true of Dick Keardon who buys Pat's poultry wholesale and sells them out retail, that he and his good woman are as like one another, as a couple of ducks. But that's not the case with Pat and his deary, for they don't match, and you'd wonder what made them mate. Seventeen or eighteen years ago,—I can't say precisely to a year, but I'll swear to the day,—it was a Tuesday; by token, that it happened the day after Luna mon moch,—the good woman's Monday,—Pat's wife was looking out for him coming home from market; and as he rode down the hill, she saw one of the panniers on the poney weighed down as if it had a load, and the other up in the air. Pat, I must tell you, was the first who brought panniers into this part of the country; the likes o' them was never seen here before, and few with any but himself since. ""What ails you, Pat?"" said the wife, as soon as Pat came within reach of her voice; it's a little voice when you're near, but it goes a good way for all that:—"" what ails you?"" says she; ""couldn't you sell your turkies?"" ""May be, I couldn't; what then?"" says he. ""Then why not load the garron partly o' both"

The result was that Lancelot fought with Sir Turquine, and defeated him. Soon after, he was 'required of a damsel to heal her brother'; and again, 'at the request of a lady' he recovered a falcon; an adventure which ended in a fight, as usual.  THE RIME OF SIR THOPAS. 161 1998. Olifaunt, i. e. Elephant ; a proper name, as Tyrwhitt observes, for a giant. Maundeville has the form olyfauntes for elephants. By some confusion the Moso-Goth. ulbandus and A.S. olfend are made to signify a camel. Spenser has put Chaucer's Olifaunt into his Faerie Queene, bk. iii. c. 7. st. 48, and makes him the brother of the giantess Argantè, and son of Typhoeus and Earth. The following description of a giant is from Libius Disconius (Percy Folio MS. vol. ii. p. 465) . He beareth haires on his brow Like the bristles of a sow, His head is great and stout; Eche arme is the lenght of an ell, His fists beene great and fell, Dints for to driue about.' Sir Libius says•If God will me grace send, Or this day come to an end I hope him for to spill,' &c. Another giant, 20 feet long, and 2 ells broad, with two boar's tusks, and also with brows like bristles of a swine, appears in Octouian Imperator, ed. Weber, iii. 196. See also the alliterative Morte Arthure, ed. Brock, p. 33. 2000. Child; see note to l. 2020. Termagaunt; one of the idols whom the Saracens (in the mediaeval romances) are supposed to worship. See The King of Tars, ed. Ritson (Met. Rom.), ii. 174-182, where the Sultan's gods are said to be Jubiter, Jovin (both forms of Jupiter), Astrot (Astarte), Mahoun (Mahomet), Appolin (Apollo), Plotoun (Pluto), and Tirmagaunt. Lybeaus Disconus (Ritson, Met. Rom. ii. 55) fought with a giant that levede yn Termagaunt. The Old French form is Tervagant, Ital. Tervagante or Trivigante, as in Ariosto. Wheeler, in his Noted Names of Fiction, gives the following account-'Ugo Foscolo says : “ Trivigante, whom the predecessors of Ariosto always couple with Apollino, is really Diana Trivia, the sister of the classical Apollo."" ... According to Panizzi, Trivagante or Tervagante is the Moon, or Diana, or Hecate, wandering under three names. Termagant was an imaginary being, supposed by the crusaders, who confounded Mahometans with pagans, to be a Mahometan deity. This imaginary personage was introduced into early English plays and moralities, and was represented as of a most violent character, so that a ranting actor might always appear to advantage in it. See Hamlet, iii. 2. 15. Fairfax, in his translation of Tasso (c. i. st. 84) speaks of Termagaunt and Mahound, but Tasso mentions. Macometto 'only. See also Spenser, F. Q. vi. 7. 47.

The commonly received account is that given by Jornandes, that he died by the bursting of a blood vessel on the night of his marriage with a beautiful maiden, whom he added to his many other wives; some, with a natural suspicion, impute it to the hand of his bride. Priscus observes, that no one ever subdued so many countries in so short a time. ... Jornandes, De Rebus Geticis, and Priscus, Excerpta de Legationibus, furnish the best existing materials for the history of Attila. For modern compilations, see Buat, Histoire des Peuples de l'Europe ; De Guignes, Hist. des Huns; and Gibbon, capp. xxxiv and xxxv;' English Cyclopædia. And see Amédée Thierry, Histoire d'Attila. Mr. Jephson (in Bell's Chaucer) quotes the account of Attila's death given by Paulus Diaconus, Gest. Rom. lib. xv: “Qui reuersus ad proprias sedes, supra plures quas habebat uxores, valde decoram, indicto nomine, sibi in matrimonium iunxit. Ob cuius nuptias profusa conuiuia exercens, dum tantum uini quantum nunquam antea insimul bibisset, cum supinus quiesceret, eruptione sanguinis, qui ei de naribus solitus erat effluere, suffocatus et extinctus est.' 1. 583.

Namely, especially. Tyrwhitt's note is as follows: 'According to the geographers, Lepe was not far from Cadiz. This wine, of whatever sort it may have been, was probably much stronger than the Gascon wines, usually drunk in England. La Rochelle and Bordeaux (1. 571), the two chief ports of Gascony, were both, in Chaucer's time, part of the English dominions.' Spanish wines might also be more alluring upon account of their great rarity. Among the Orders of the Royal Household, in 1604, is the following (MS. Harl. 293, fol. 162): “ And whereas, in tynes past, Spanish wines, called Sacke, were little or noe whit used in our courte, and that in later years, though not of ordinary allowance, it was thought convenient that noblemen ... might have a boule or glas, &c. We understanding that it is now used as common drinke . . . reduce the allowance to xii. gallons a day for the court,”' &c. Several regulations to be observed by London vintners are mentioned in the Liber Albus, ed. Riley, pp. 614-618. Amongst them is— Item, that white wine of Gascoigne, of la Rochele, of Spain, or other place, shall not be put in cellars with Rhenish wines.' See also note to l. 565. 1. 564.

FREDERICK the Second, king of Prussia, after his conquest of Saxony, transported, it is said,* by force, several manufacturers from Dresden to Berlin, where he was very desirous of establishing the manufacture of china. These unfortunate people, separated from their friends, their home, and their native country, were compelled to continue their labours for the profit and for the glory of their conqueror. Amongst the number of those sufferers was Sophia Mansfeld. She was young, handsome, and possessed considerable talents. Several pieces of porcelain of her design and modelling were shown to Frederick, when he visited the manufactory at Meissen, in Saxony; and their taste and workmanship appeared to him so exquisite, that he determined to transport the artist to his capital. But from the time of her arrival at Berlin, Sophia Mansfeld's genius seemed to forsake her.

FREDERICK the Second, king of Prussia, after his conquest of Saxony, transported, it is said, * by force, Several manufacturers from Dresden to Berlin, where he was very desirous of establishing the manufacture of china. These unfortunate people, separated from their friends, their home, and their native country, were compelled to continue their labours for the profit and for the glory of their conqueror. Amongst the number of those sufferers was Sophia Mansfeld. She was young, handsome, and possessed considerable talents. Several pieces of porcelain of her design and modelling were shown to Frederick, when he visited the manufactory at Meissen, in Saxony; and their taste and workmanship appeared to him so exquisite, that he determined to transport the artist to his capital. But from the time of her arrival at Berlin, Sophia Mansfeld's genius seemed to forsake her. It was her business to sketch designs, and to paint them • Vide Wraxall's Memoirs of the Court of Berlin.  168 THE PRUSSIAN VASE. on the porcelain; but either she could not or would not execute these with her former elegance: the figures were awkward and spiritless, and it was in vain that the overseer of the works attempted to rouse her to exertion ; she would sit for hours, with her pencil in her hand, in a sort of"

But what can one do, you know? One must submit to all that; for they tell me there's no other way of securing to one's children a good French pronunciation. How will you manage about that?” “Helen and Emma,” said Mrs. Temple,“ read and understand French as well as I could wish, and if they ever go to France I hope they will be able to catch the accent as I have never suffered them to acquire any fixed bad habits of speaking it.” “0,"" said Lady s o bad habits are what I dread of all things for Augusta.

Helen was touched by this speech, especially as she entirely believed her sister, for Emma was not one who made sentimental speeches. A short time after this visit, Mrs. Temple took her two daughters with her, to dine at Lady S- 's. As they happened to go rather earlier than usual, they found nobody in the drawing-room but the French governess, Mademoiselle Panache. Helen, it seems, had conceived a very sublime idea of a French governess, and when she first came into the room she looked up to Mademoiselle Panache with a mixture of awe and admiration. Mademoiselle was not much troubled with any of that awkward reserve which seems in England sometimes to keep strangers at bay for the first quarter of an hour of their acquaintance. She could not, it is true, speak English very fluently, but this only increased her desire to speak it; and between two languages she found means, with some difficulty, to express herself. The conversation, after the usual preliminary nothings had been gone over, turned upon France and French literature. Mrs. Temple said she was going to purchase some French books for her daughters, and very politely begged to know what authors Mademoiselle would particularly recommend. “ Vat auteurs ?”—you do me much honourmadame_"" Vat auteurs ? why, Mesdemoiselles, there's Telemaque and Belisaire."" Helen and Emma had read Telemaque and Belisaire, so Mademoiselle was obliged to think again. “ Attendez !"" cried she, putting up her fore-finger in an attitude of recollection.

Alderman Holloway arrived, and was beginning to talk to Dr. B. of his son's proficiency in his studies, when the young gentleman made his appearance with a countenance extremely embarrassed and agitated. The sight of Dr. B. deprived Holloway of courage to speak. The doctor fixed his penetrating eye upon the pale culprit, who immediately stopped short in the middle of the room, stammering out-“I came to speak, sir-I had something to say to my father, sir-I came, if you please, to speak to my father, sir.” To Holloway's utter astonishment, Dr. B.'s countenance and manner suddenly changed at these words; all his severity vanished ; and, with a look and voice the most encouraging, he led the abashed youth toward his father. “ You came to speak to your father,  THE GOOD AUNT. 127"

Then the chief, who was really a very intelligent fellow, made himself somewhat more agreeable to the three whites, and to Bardik and Li he offered a pinch from his tobacco-pouch, and then sat down at the bivouac. A glass of something offered him by the Neapolitan put him into excellent humour, and when he rose, after an hour or so, during which silence not unfrequently reigned for minutes at a time, it was to invite the travellers to visit him in the morning at his kraal. This was promised, and after shaking hands Lopepe majestically retired. He had not been gone long before all in camp were asleep except Cyprien, who, wrapped in his blanket, lay gazing at the stars. There was no moon, but the black field of the sky was aglow with its glittering dust. He thought of his people, who knew nothing of this plunge of his into the South African desert. He thought of Alice, dearer than all to him, who was, perhaps, at that moment star-gazing, as he was ; and sinking deeper and deeper into his reverie, he was about to fall asleep, when a trampling of hoofs, a curious agitation on the side where the bullock team was parked for the night, made him wake up and start to his feet.

A fearful growl arose as the reply to this sudden attack. It was a lion l and the young engineer had treated it as if it were a cur.

And as those young noblemen, recognising the justice of public opinion, have retired to their estates, which they are now occupied peacefully in administering and improving, so have the young earls and marquesses of the court of REGINA of Regent Street calmly subsided into the tillage of the pleasant fields of literature, and the cultivation of the fresh green crops of goodhumoured thought. My little work on the differential calculus, for instance, is in a most advanced state ; and you will correct me if I break a confidence in saying, that your translation of the first hundred and ninety-six chapters of the Mahabharata will throw some extraordinary light upon a subject most intensely interesting to England, viz. the Sanscrit theosophy. This introduction, then, will have prepared you for an exceedingly humane and laudatory notice of the packet of works which you were good enough to send me, and which, though they doubtless contain a great deal that the critic would not write (from the extreme delicacy of his taste and the vast range of his learning), also contain, between ourselves, a great deal that the critic could not write if he would ever so: and this is a truth which critics are sometimes apt to forget in their judgments of works of fiction. As a rustical boy, hired at twopence per week, may fling stones at the blackbirds and drive them off and possibly hit one or two, yet if he get into the  400 CRITICAL REVIEWS hedge and begin to sing, he will make a wretched business of the music, and Lubin and Colin and the dullest swains of the village will laugh egregiously at his folly ; so the critic employed to assault the poet — But the rest of the simile is obvious, and will be apprehended at once by a person of your experience. The fact is, that the blackbirds of letters--the harmless, kind singing creatures who line the hedgesides and chirp and twitter as nature bade them (they can no more help singing, these poets, than a flower can help smelling sweet), have been treated much too ruthlessly by the watch-boys of the press, who have a love for flinging stones at the little innocents, and pretend that it is their duty, and that every wren or sparrow is likely to destroy a whole field of wheat, or to turn out a monstrous bird of prey. Leave we these vain sports and savage pastimes of youth, and turn we to the benevolent philosophy of maturer age. A characteristic of the Irish writers and people, which has not been at all appreciated by the English, is, I think, that of extreme melancholy. All Irish stories are sad, all humorous Irish songs are sad ; there is never a burst of laughter excited by them but, as I fancy, tears are near at hand; and

But we in England have adopted our idea of the Irishman, and, like the pig-imitator's audience in the fable (which simile is not to be construed into an opinion on  A BOX OF NOVELS 401 the writer's part that the Irish resemble pigs, but simply that the Saxon is dull of comprehension), we will have the sham Irishman in preference to the real one, and will laugh at the poor wag, whatever his mood may be. The romance-writers and dramatists have wronged the Irish cruelly (and so has every Saxon among them, the O'Connellites will say) in misrepresenting them as they have done. What a number of false accounts, for instance, did poor Power give to English playgoers, about Ireland! He led Cockneys to suppose that all that Irish gaiety was natural and constant; that Paddy was in a perpetual whirl of high spirits and whisky; for ever screeching and whooping mad songs and wild jokes ; a being entirely devoid of artifice and calculation : it is only after an Englishman has seen the country that he learns how false these jokes are ; how sad these high spirits, and how cunning and fitful that exuberant joviality, which we have been made to fancy are the Irishman's everyday state of mind. There is, for example, the famous Sir Lucius O'Trigger of Sheridan, at whose humours we all laugh delightfully. He is the most real character, in all that strange company of profligates and swindlers who people Sheridan's plays, and I think the most profoundly dismal of all. The poor Irish knight's jokes are only on the surface. He is a hypocrite all through the comedy, and his fun no more real than his Irish estate. He makes others laugh, but he does not laugh himself, as Falstaff does, and Sydney Smith, and a few other hearty humorists of the British sort. So when he reads in the “Opinions of the Press” how the provincial journalists are affected with Mr. Lever's books; how the Doncaster Argus declares, “We have literally roared with laughter over the last number of Our Mess';"" or the Manx Mercury vows it has “absolutely burst with cachinnation” over the facetice of friend Harry Lorrequer; or the Bungay Beacon has been obliged to call in two printer's devils to hold the editorial sides while perusing “Charles O'Malley's ” funny stories ; let the reader be assured that he has fallen upon critical opinions not worth the having.

And by the same time it had come home to its leaders, and, indeed, to every one who used his reason at all, that it was very far from certain that there were any Christians in Sicca, and if so, still very far from easy to say where they were. And the difficulty was of so practical a character as to keep them inactive for the space of several hours. Meanwhile their passions were excited to the boiling point by the very presence of the difficulty, as inen go mad of thirst when water is denied them. At length, after a long season of such violent commotion, such restless pain, such curses, shrieks, and blasphemies, such bootless gesticulations, such aimless contests with cach other, that they seemed to be already inmates of the prison beneath, they set off in a blind way to make the circuit of the city as before they had paraded round the Forum, still in the knighterrant line, looking out for what might turn up where they were sure of nothing, and relieving the intense  190 Callista; irritation of their passions by locomotion, if nothing more substantial was offered to them. It was an awful day for the respectable inhabitants of the place; worse than anything that even the most timid of them had anticipated, when they had showed their jealousy of a popular movement against the prescribed religion; for the stimulus of famine and pestilence was added to hatred of Christianity, in that unreasoning multitude. The magistrates shut themselves up in dismay; the small body of Roman soldiery reserved their strength for the defence of themselves; and the poor wretches, not a few, who had fallen from the faith, and offered sacrifice, hung out from their doors sinful heathen symbols, to avert a storm against which apostasy was no sufficient safeguard. In this conduct the Gnostics and other sectaries imitated them, while the Tertullianists took a more manly part, from principle or pride. It would require the brazen voice which Homer speaks of, or the magic pen of Sir Walter, to catalogue and to picture, as far as it is lawful to do either, the figures and groups of that most miserable procession. As it went forward it gained a variety and strength, which the circuit of the Forum could not furnish. The more respectable religious establishments shut their gates, and would have nothing to do with it.

The late army of Fleetwood, excepting two regiments commanded by men whom Monk could perfectly trust, were ordered to leave the city, and the general of the army of Scotland entered at the head of his troops, who, rough from  SECOND SERIES. 235 a toilsome march, and bearing other marks of severe service, made a far more hardy and serviceable, though a less showy appearance, than those who had so long bridled the people of London. General Monk, and the remnant of the Parliament, met each other with external civility, but with great distrust on both sides. They propounded to him the oath of abjuration, as it was called, by which he was to renounce and abjure all allegiance to the House of Stewart, and all attempts to restore Charles II. But the General declined taking the oath; too many oaths, he said, had been already imposed on the public, unless they had been better kept. This circumstance seemed to throw light on Monk's intentions, and the citizens of London, now as anxious for the King's Restoration as ever they had been for the expulsion of his father, passed a vote in Common Council, by which they declared they would pay no taxes or contributions to this shadow of a Parliament, until the vacant seats in it should be filled up to the full extent of a genuine House of Commons. The Rump Parliament had now, they conceived, an opportunity of ascertaining Monk's real purpose, and forcing him to a decisive measure. They laid their express commands on him to march into the city, seize upon the gates, break down the portcullises, destroy the ports, chains, and other means of defending the streets, and take from the contumacious citizens all means of protecting in future the entrance into the capital. Monk, to the astonishment of most of his own officers, obeyed the commands thus imposed on him. He was probably desirous of ascertaining whether the disposition of his troops would induce them to consider the task as a harsh and unworthy one. Accordingly, he no sooner heard his soldiers exclaiming at the disgrace of becoming the tools of the vengeance of the Rump members against the City of London, than he seemed to adopt their feelings and passions as his own, and like them complained, and complained aloud, of  236 TALES OF A GRANDFATHER. having been employed in an unjust and unpopular task, for the express purpose of rendering himn odious to the citizens. At this crisis, the rashness of the ruling junto, for it would be absurd to term them a Parliament, gave the General, whom it was their business to propitiate if possible, a new subject of complaint. They encouraged a body of the most fanatical sectaries, headed by a ridiculous personage called Praise-God Barebones, to present a violent petition to the House, demanding that no one should be admitted to any office of public trust, or so much as

You may read of these in books of travels, told in a manner that I cannot aspire to rival. I must be content with speaking of the general effect, as it related to myself. 'I remember waking early in the morning, and from my window, which looked over the Adriatic sea, I saw the sun struggling onwards in a sea of vapor. His track appeared nearly in the point of Trieste. The waters of the gulf lay silent, stretching away south and north, a melancholy plain without life or motion. I began to augur ill of the Venetian festival, but I was agreeably disappointed. For in about an hour the god of day threw off his cloudy bondage, and looked out upon us like, what he really is in southern climates, the living wonder and paragon of the heavens. The wind began to stir and freshen, and the waves curled and broke along the shore. The distant mountains, which had before looked cold and mournful, awoke to a new life, and put on their richest colors. The people opened their windows, there was a hum of voices and laughing, and the splashing of water in the canals below. One after one, the little boats and gondolas shot out from creeks and corners, and shook their tiny streamers to the breeze; men and women, in new gay dresses, were seen; rowers and gondolieri, and holi 132 A DAY IN VENICE. day-making girls from the neighboring continent, while the servants seemed to go about blithely on their morning errands. It was clear that the day would be in our favor, and accordingly we prepared to do it honor, by displaying before the curious Venetian ladies some of the elegances of our English apparel. We had ordered a gondola to be ready early, and after we had taken our coffee, we descended to where it lay waiting our arrival. ' “The time appointed for the procession not having arrived, we bade the gondolieri row us through some of the different streets of the city, to witness the preparations that were making in all quarters from the Doge to the beggar. The English traveller who has not visited this corner of Italy, cannot have any idea of the delight of gliding along from street to street, by churches and palaces and marble houses, without an effort of his own. It is more like the motion which we enjoy (or seem to enjoy) in a dream than anything else. I lay on the soft cushions of the gondola, and from underneath the pleasant shadow which the curtains made, I looked up at the architectural splendors; at windows filled with eastern-looking women, some gazing on the boats below, some glancing at the sky, (to see if the day were likely to be overcast,) some arranging

Norfolk, astonished at so sudden and unexpected a termination to his quarrel with the Earl of Hereford, broke out into most pathetic complaints, and revolted against this mandate of the king. He was prepared to encounter death from the sword of his adversary:—but the sentence of perpetual banishment, was as dreadful as unexpected! A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege, And all unlooked for from your highness' mouth : The language I have learned these forty years, My native English, I must now forego: And now my tongue's use is to me no more, Than an unstringed viol, or a harp ; Or, like a cunning instrument cased up, Or, being open, put into his hands That knows no touch to tune the harmony. Within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue, Doubly portcullis'd, with my teeth, and lips: And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance Is made my gaoler to attend on me. I am too old to fawn upon a nurse, Too far in years to be a pupil now; What is thy sentence then, but speechless death, Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?*** Richard was little disposed to mitigate the sentence he had passed ;—he was well pleased at any circumstance which would remove from his presence two persons equally obnoxious to himself and to his favourites ; neither was the question in debate, one he wished should be too far dwelt upon. Bolinbroke's ostensible complaint, against Mowbray, was treason; but his deepest aim was evidently to draw to light the suspicions respecting the Duke of Glocester's death, an event in which Richard was too deeply concerned to consent that much inquiry should take place ! To Norfolk's remonstrances  206 TALES OF THE DRAMA. therefore he coolly replied, that after sentence was passed, complaining was useless. With a heavy heart Mowbray quitted bis native land, and retired to Venice, where he soon afterwards died of a broken heart!! Bolinbroke, who probably meant even at that time to derive advantage from his unjust banishment, bore his sentence with the most perfect composure; but his father, John of Gaunt, was overwhelmed with grief at this sad separation, and Richard, affected by his sorrow, and by Bolinbroke's uncomplaining submission to his will, rescinded four years of his banishment, assuring him --when that period should be expired, that his return should be welcomed most cordially! A very short time elapsed from the departure of Bolinbroke, ere John of Gaunt was taken ill, and his life despaired of. He sent to request an interview with his royal cousin, hoping that the admonitions of a dying man might have some effect in awakening the young king to

In the ghostly dawn, gray creeping o'er darksome hill and hollow, the figures could be faintly discerned of armed men who, with their centurion, stood at their posts, as did the Roman sentinels in long-buried cities before the gloom and crash of the volcano. Yet, as the van of the great hosts of insurgents neared them, the wings of which stretched as far as could be seen, some natural anxiety must have arisen as to their intentions in approaching the tiny citadel. The police barracks and temporary gaol, popularly termed The Logs,' from the massive timber employed in all parts of their construction, were substantial if rude edifices, calculated to stand a siege against any reasonably superior attacking force. But the present league, if such it proved to be, would be as the tidal-wave of the ocean to the fisherman's boat-shed-the lakeflood to the beaver-dam. A few shots might be fired in desperation; a score or two of the rioters killed and wounded.

The Natchez flew to arms, and the French were assailed on every side, and many of them fell. The Stung Serpent, an influential chief, interposed his authority, and the slaughter ceased. A new treaty of peace was the result of the discussion that ensued, and the whole affair seemed to be buried in oblivion. “ Soon after this, in the year 1723, under different pretexts, several hundred soldiers were secretly introduced into the settlement, and the defenceless and unsuspecting Natchez were slaughtered in their huts. The head of the first chief was demanded as the price of peace, and the wretched Natchez were obliged to yield to the demand. The slaughter had continued four days, before peace was granted them. This was a deed, of course, never to be forgotten nor forgiven by the savages. They saw at once, that there now remained no alternative  86 HISTORY OF THE WESTERN STATES. between their own destruction or that of their enemies. They were moody, pensive, timid and slow; but they were sure in devising the means of vengeance. “ Things remained in this situation until 1729. At this time, M. de Chopart, who had been the chief agent in these transactions, and who was excessively obnoxious to the savages, had been ordered to New Orleans, to meet an investigation of his conduct touching this affair. The joy of the savages was great; for they hoped, at least, to be delivered from his enmity and oppression. To their despair, they learned that he was justified, and reinstated in his authority. He seemed, on his return, more vindictive towards them than ever. To manifest his ill feelings, he determined to build a town, two miles below the present site of Natchez, on ground occupied by a large and ancient village of the Indians. Accordingly, he sent for the Sun chief, and ordered him to have the savage huts cleared away, and the inhabitants dispersed. The chief replied, that their ancestors had dwelt there for ages ; and that it was good that their descendants should dwell there after them. The order was repeated, with a threat of destruction, if not obeyed. “ The Indians dissembled ; and, remarking 'that the corn had just come out of the ground, and that their hens were laying their eggs, and that to abandon their village at that time would  HISTORY OF THE

Macaskill, in the small island of Berneray, Aug. 1859.-MAC A GHoBHA, The Smith's Son. A smith takes the place of the old fisherman. The mermaid rises beside his boat, gets the promise of the son, and sends him fish. (The three mysterious grains are omitted). One son is born to the fisher, and the mermaid lets him remain till he is fourteen years of age. BHA 'N GILLE 'N so CHo MoR AN CEAUNN NAN CEITHIR BLIADHNA DIAG!

To such we have little to say in justification of ourselves. We have enabled every reader to judge for himself; and we have merely exercised our right in offering an opinion on facts patent to all. These facts we have detailed at as great length as our limits would permit, and for the very purpose of placing data for judgment within the reach of all who feel an interest in the matter. They have been gathered exclusively from contemporary writers,--from men, too, who seem to have thought more favourably of James than we do: they are therefore free from any bias which might have been communicated by a perusal of the narratives of later historians only. For ourselves we can vouch, that we began and completed the collection and collation in the most impartial spirit, and so far from consulting modern writers, we have never even tried to recollect what opinions they had formed. If, therefore, the results we have drawn are either partial or unjust, our philosophy is at fault, and we must stand convicted of deducing erroneous conclusions from the premises before us.  KING ROBERT BRUCE'S CASTLE, 221 THE FORTUNES OF KING ROBERT BRUCE'S CASTLE. LOCHMABEN CASTLE, the paternal residence of Bruce, stood on the extreme point of a heart-shaped peninsula which juts a considerable way into the south side of the Castle-loch. Across the isthmus at the entrance of the peninsula are vestiges of a deep fosse, which admitted at both ends the waters of the lake, and converted the site of the Castle into an island, and over which a well-guarded drawbridge gave ingress or refused it to the interior. Within this outer fosse, at brief intervals, are a second, a third, and a fourth, of similar character. The last stretched from side to side of the peninsula immediately at the entrance of the Castle; it was protected in front by a strong arched wall or ledge, behind which a besieged force could shield themselves while they galled, at a distance, an approaching foe; and it had at the centre a drawbridge which led into the interior building, and which was probably the last post an enemy required to force in order to be master of the fortress. Two archways at the northeastern and south-western angles of the building, through which the water of the fosse was received or emptied, remain entire. But no idea can now be formed of the original beauty or polish either of this outwork or of the stupendous and magnificent pile which it assisted to defend. Gothic hands began generations ago to treat the Castle of the Bruce as merely a vulgar and convenient quarry; and, for the sake of the stones, they have peeled away every foot of the ashler. work which lined the exterior and the interior of its walls. So far has barbarian rapacity been carried, that now only the heart or packing of some of the walls is left, exhibiting giant masses of small stones

There was some shrieking and fainting among the ladies, of course. The American army, at this time about Boston, was but little better provided for than the English. Many fell sick with fatigue and exposure. They had provisions enough from the country, to be sure, while the English troops were said to be living wholly on salt meat, and the Boston tories upon horse-flesh. But the whole number, in January, was  AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 105 e reduced to less than ten thousand; and these, hav. ing enlisted for a few months only, were every day going home. At one time, there were hardly men enough to man the lines. As for powder, they had but four rounds to a man; and but four small brass cannon, and a few old iron pieces, full of holes, with the wood-work broken off. They were fitted into logs, like the barrel of a gun into the stock, and lifted up and down, and wheeled about in this way, but to some good purpose. The British laughed at these machines, at first, but they soon found them no laughing matter. They kept up a continual cannonade, in return; firing about two thousand shot and bomb-shells, it is said, in the course of a few months. But the whole of this firing killed only twelve Americans. It was about this time, that a party of the English officers, walking on Beacon Hill, in the course of the season, in the evening, were frightened by terrible noises in the air. They ran down the hill with the greatest despatch. It seems that they mistook the buzzing of a few beetles and bugs, for the whizzing of “air-guns.” They suspected that the cunning Yankees had contrived some queer machines for killing them, without the noise of gunpowder. This is not a very important story; but I am glad to find something amusing to tell you, amid so many tales of battles and bloodshed. I will now tell you another story ; it relates to  106 AMERICAN REVOLUTION.  British Officers frightened by Bugs.

It seems there were two cannon kept in a gunhouse opposite the Mall, at the corner of West street, in the care of one Paddock. The British found it out, and Paddock promised to deliver them up. A party of school boys undertook to prevent him from doing it. The school-house was the next building to the gun-house, separated only by a yard, common to both, and surrounded by a high fence. The boys contrived to enter the gun-house windows, in the rear, in spite of an English guard, which had been placed before the building. The guns were taken off their carriages, carried into the school-room, and placed"

The soldier persisted to demand prompt payment, threatening him with a beating, if he refused. Even the threat of being struck is ever insupportable to an Indian.  HISTORY OF THE WESTERN STATES. 85 The old man sprang incensed from the fort, and challenged the soldier to single combat. The soldier, alarmed by the rage of the Indian, cried Murder ! The warrior on this, and seeing a crowd collecting, retired slowly towards his village. One of the guard fired upon him, and he was mortally wounded. No inquiry was made, or at least no punishment inflicted on him who had committed the outrage. - “All the revengeful feelings, natural to savages, were called up on the occasion. . The Natchez flew to arms, and the French were assailed on every side, and many of them fell. The Stung Serpent, an influential chief, interposed his authority, and the slaughter ceased. . A new treaty of peace was the result of the discussion that ensued, and the whole affair seemed to be buried in oblivion. “Soon after this, in the year 1723, under different pretexts, several hundred soldiers were secretly introduced into the settlement, and the defenceless and unsuspecting Natchez were slaughtered in their huts. The head of the first chief was demanded as the price of peace, and the wretched Natchez were obliged to yield to the demand. The slaughter had continued four days, before peace was granted them. This was a deed, of course, never to be forgotten nor forgiven by the savages. They saw at once, that there now remained no alternative . 8  86 HISTORY OF THE WESTERN STATES. between their own destruction or that of their enemies. They were moody, pensive, timid and slow ; but they were sure in devising the means of vengeance. “ Things remained in this situation until 1729. At this time, M. de Chopart, who had been the chief agent in these transactions, and who was excessively obnoxious to the savages, had been ordered to New Orleans, to meet an investigation of his conduct tonching this affair. The joy of the savages was great; for they hoped, at least, to be delivered from his enmity and oppression. To their despair, they learned that he was justified, and reinstated in his authority. He seemed, on his return, more vindictive towards them than ever. To manifest his ill feelings, he determined to build a town, two miles below the present site of Natchez, on ground occupied by a large and ancient village of the Indians. Accordingly, he sent for the Sun chief, and ordered him to have the savage huts cleared away, and the inhabitants dispersed. The chief replied, 'that their ancestors had dwelt there for ages ; and that it was good that their descendants should dwell there after them. The order was repeated, with a threat of

To him I will impart the story of my guilt, and seek his aid in propitiating offended Heaven. ver Is the mark of Cain upon my forehead? My acquaintance look me in the face, bow coldly, and turn away. Some shun me and pass by on the other side of the way; and all look upon me with an apparent mixture of pity and horror. Are the inward emotions of my mind written upon my face? Well, I care not. I have worse evils than neglect to encounter. I have been to the cathedral; but Father Ambrose was not there. I wandered about that magnificent temple, and gazed upon the works of art, the semblances of holy men, that adorn its walls. I saw other men kneeling at the confessional, and then going away with an aspect of joy and tranquillity. But I would not confess at that time. I have reserved my confession for the ear of Father Ambrose, and no other shall receive it. It is passing strange. I marvel that shadows, and dreams, and transient reminiscences, can so unman me.

She often heard from Jane, who wrote very cheerfully, and was getting along much better than she expected, having as many pupils as she could possibly attend to, and occasionally giving a sort of private concert. She never spoke of George in connection with Ellen, in her letters to the latter. Since Nannie's marriage Ellen had gone much more into society, partly from a feeling of loneliness, and partly from necessity; for now she had all the visiting to do. She was always admired, and had a steady set of beaux-not stupid or dull ones; for she was noted for the class of her admirers, they being men of intellect. If, in the circle in which they moved, there appeared one gentleman distinguished above the others for talent, George or Mr. Levering were sure to introduce him ; thus, without ever being a belle, she always received much attention. About this time, Mr. Levering called upon her one day, and asked her for a letter to Jane. He was going to the city where she lived, should call upon her, and would like to be the bearer of a letter. The letter was written, and he departed, promising to call as soon as he returned, and bring Ellen news of her friends. One day Mrs. Mason received a letter from an old friend, a sort of connection, from whom she had not heard for a long time, and supposed must be dead. Mrs. Royton--for that was the old lady's name-proposed to visit them, Mrs. Mason being the only connection she had in the world, and they having been schoolmates together. Directly upon the reception of this epistle, a most cordial and affectionate letter was dispatched to the old lady, requesting her to come immediately and pay them a long visit. . Mrs. Royton had arrived, and a pleasant sight it was to see  212 LIFE'S LESSON. those two together. They would sit by the hour and talk of the companions of their early days—whom this one had married—how many children she had-how they had turned out. Then another would come upon the tapis, her prospects in early life be discussed-how well she might have done, and how she did not do. And the beaux of their youth were brought forward—there were none like them now. The dress of their times was contrasted with the modern fashions ; while the costume of some particular night -remembered from some compliment received, or some conquest made-would be elaborately described. Thus would they talk the scenes of their youth over and over, until they almost fancied themselves the fair, graceful forms they were half a century before, decked out in their ball-dresses, the stars of some festive scene; while

At such times his thoughts almost invariably took the form of words, and he appeared to derive increased self-satisfaction from the sound of his own voice. On the present occasion he drew off his boots, incased his feet in a pair of morocco slippers, lighted a fragrant Havana, and settled himself comfortably down to think aloud. “For a man of sense,” so ran his thoughts, “for a man of sense, and very few troublesome scruples, Hamilton was startled more than could have been expected when I hinted at the indispensable necessity of putting George Washington out of the way when our plans were ripe, or nearly so. I am glad I mentioned it so soon. He must grow familiar with the idea before the time comes for putting it into execution. He has gone off now believing it impossible that his consent can ever be given to my suggestion; but I have read the book of human nature too attentively to be deceived in such a case. It is one of those ideas which, when they once obtain an entrance into a man's head, will  TII E RIVAL S. 149 come back, no matter how often they may be driven away, and every time they present a less forbidding aspect. There will be no necessity for me to refer to it again. It will force itself upon his attention, and, in process of time, he will come to regard it as a very dear and familiar friend, whose society, instead of creating uneasiness, is of exceeding comfort in dark and cloudy weather. On that score I have no fears, notwithstanding his seeming horror at the proposition; and the net I have been so industriously weaving, in that part at least is sound. My chief apprehension is the want of time. Our hopes will be as effectually blasted by an early termination of the war, as by England's reconquest of her provinces. Brother Jonathan comes of a stiffnecked race, who have, before now, taken off the heads of legitimate sovereigns, and he is of a temper to follow the ancestral example, if any premature usurper should attempt to fetter his limbs before he is completely wearied and disgusted by successive years of lawlessness and blood. In that case only will he consent to exchange his dreams of freedom for the government of a prince, albeit that prince should be of his own selection. We are getting along too fast now, and I must contrive to put some clog upon the wheels. An occasional hint to Sir William Howe, such as may enable him to gain partial successes, will do the business—and, by the Lord, he shall have it !

It was a fearful sight. At length the bridle fell from Rosa's hands ; she clenched hold of the horse's mane; the agony of fear prevented her uttering a single cry; her face was lividly pale, her eyes distended, whilst large drops stood upon her brow. The animal paused for one instant, stood for a moment at the base of a large mountain. “Oh !” faintly moaned Rosa—but it was only one plaintive exclamation, and that one was the last.

And still shone the pale moon,—and the lambent stars were lighting the spot,—and the breeze was as quiet, all as serene-but poor Rosa was dead! Presently Eldrido dismounted, and stood upon the mountain's brow, and cautiously descending the ravine, he stood a horrorstricken spectator of the dreadful sight. Horse and rider were dead; and her he had so bravely rescued was a mass of disfigurement, a shockingly livid corpse.

At last, they could endure that life no longer, and decided to go in search of Crowbar. They would beg his pardon on their knees, and perhaps in his kindness of heart he would forgive them and render some assistance. Having taken that resolution, they set out for the · king's palace. On reaching it they inquired for Crowbar. He came to meet them, and was greatly surprised to see their poverty. His first impulse was to forgive them and treat them kindly; but the king, who knew of their doings, forbade him to receive them, and ordered them thrown into prison, and there they ended their days. Crowbar, meanwhile, had become a powerful prince, and was much beloved by the king. He reared a large family of children, and finally died in peace and plenty surrounded by many friends. The castle of La Ferrière became again habitable, since the devil had ceased to haunt it, and the Marquis, his children, and their descendants have dwelt happily in it ever since.

The sun was setting when he finished, and we were néaring a town. Several of our fellow-travelers had dropped off by the way, my companion and I shook hands at the gate of the town, and I was left alone to go to the inn. I spent a very good night there, and the next day I hardly know where I went. I believe that was the day I met the hautboy player - he was a jolly fellow, though! He made it lively for us going through the big woods. I'll tell you about the hautboy player of Ventabrén. I had been walking alone through a flat country until, just as I came to an extensive piece of woods, I met a man; and we were going through the woods in company when it happened that, as another trail met ours, we fell in with a man and a small boy.  126 Tales of Languedoc “Halloa! you here, Fougasse ?” shouted my compan. ion, as the man joined us. “I am he,"" replied the newcomer. “Where do you come from?” “Té!

He carried a bundle swung on the end of a stick over his shoulder - it was a big fougasse tied in a napkin. The little boy carried on his back, strapped to his shoulders, a tambourin, and — pecaïre!* he could hardly walk with his load, so young was he. Speaking to the"

For this morning it was really work. She could not disguise the fact, and when her mother next entered the room she saw plainly the signs of her trouble and dissatisfaction. “What is it, then, Katryntje?” she asked, as she seated herself and looked sadly at her daughter. And Catharine did exactly as older persons do — she laid the blame of her tears and trouble, not on herself, but on the most convenient person outside herself. She said it was impossible for her not to notice how much her grandmother thought of Gertrude and Alida, and how little she cared for her. “As for Paul,” she added, “she never named him, and yet he is her only grandson.” “My dear one !” answered Madame Van I43  Trinity Bells Clyffe, “no one can make others to love them. And you cannot go to the market and buy love; it must be freely given. But look here, your grandmother knows you not; very seldom has she seen you. But Gertrude and Alida have been nursed in her arms. Their mother died when Gertrude was not yet two years old and Alida but two weeks. Then your grandmother took the motherless little ones to her heart. Also she was not opposed to your Uncle Jacob's wife, and to me she was much opposed; that made much difference. Now, Tryntje, think of this, your cousins have your grandmother, but you have your mother Am I not sufficient?” Then, with kisses and tears, Catharine clung to her darling mother, and told her she was “the dearest, sweetest heart in all the world !” And her mother held her on her knees, and petted and blessed her, and said “her little daughter had been the joy and the strength of her life,” and so wiped all tears away.

Yet the depths of her young heart were still troubled, though a smile like sunshine hid their restlessness and gloom.

Why was she working Why not take her pleasure like other girls of her age? Would not her mother have managed without her help? At any rate, would not Uncle Jacob have helped in her place.

There is no reason, in the nature of things, why a collision should not occur between the earth and one of the many “monstrous and lawless wanderers of the skies.” Nor is it inconceivable that such a collision in the remote past did occur. Assuming this to be true, many remarkable and now mysterious phenomena on the earth's surface could be easily explained.

He is generally supposed to have given the hint of the subject, by suggesting to Gay to write a Newgate pastoral. While these three wits, indeed, held their meetings at Twickenham, it may be difficult to assign to each individual his share . in a labour which they were all willing to further.

The king's death, and the probable dismissal of Walpole from office, interrupted his purpose, and lighted up, for the last time, those hopes of comfort at least, if not of am. bition, which depended on his being settled in England. A change of ministry was generally expected. Swift, accustomed to disappointment, was less sanguine than others, and hesitated wbe. ther he should suspend his journey to the Conti. nent. Bolingbroke urged him to remain, and expressed his belief, that the opportunity of quit. ting England for Ireland was fairly before him. He remained, accordingly, kissed the hands of their Majesties on their accession, and was received by the Queen with her usual marks of fa-vour. But Sir Robert Walpole, through the interest of Queen Caroline, triumphed over all his rivals, and on the 24th June was reinstated in the employments and confidence which he enjoyed under the former monarch. Still, however, it was supposed, that the secret influence of Mrs Howard might serve her friends. Swift wrote to her requesting her advice concerning his intention of going abroad, and conjuring her to answer him with sincerity. Mrs Howard replied, exhorting him not to leave England, as it would have an appearance of disaffection; and other friends seemed to have  JONATHAN SWIFT, D.

Sir Robert Walpole's interest, and probably that of Queen Caroline, who in secret opposed all who sought favours at court through the mediation of Mrs Howard, rendered vain the expectations which were thus excited. Mrs Howard afterwards vindicated herself, by stating, that if success did not justify her advice, she had at least

The corn probably waved on the hills, the vine clustered over the fig tree, which was yielding its own fruits, and the emerald hue of the meads was varied doubtless by flowers more beautiful than those which still spring by thousands on hill and dale, gladdening the senses, and cheering the spirit of man by their odours. “Spring robed the vales. With what a flood of light She held her revels in that sunny clime, The flower-sown turf, like bossy velvet bright, The blossomed trees exulting in their prime !” Yes, the wide world is still beautiful—it is still a garden of God; but it is probably a faint shadow of the world when it was first created, and no earthly garden now can compare with the lustre of the garden of Eden. Our first parents must have gazed on the  GRASS, HERBs, ETC. 9 green earth with intense feelings of innocent delight. With intellects instructed by Jehovah, though untaught by experience, they must have felt all the love of novelty with which the young child looks on nature, added to the sublime contemplation of the world and its great Creator, for which they were fitted from the moment when God breathed into them the breath of life, and they became living souls. The fruits and the green herb were given them for meat, and were to be kept in order, by that moderate exertion which should have served but to vary the leisure of their existence; and to be in a garden, to dress it and to keep it, was the happy lot ordained for them, till sin spread its baleful influence, alike on the heart of man and the face of nature, withering the purity of the soul, and the outward beauty of the earth. As Pliny observed, many centuries since, no colour is more pleasant to the eye than green, and a great enjoyment is borne into the mind as the eye looks on the grass and green leaves —an enjoyment the more appreciated by him who has travelled over deserts in the scorching season, and marked their sterile brown tint, varied only as it softened into the purple or azure of the distant horizon. And how universal is the “grass and the green herb "" Even the wide deserts of the east are, in most cases, covered during the winter and spring with a rich and tender grass, and the most desolate and arid wastes have still their oases—“the pastures of the wilderness,” of which the psalmist  10 PLANT'S AND TREES OF SCRIPTURE. speaks, when he says of them that “the little hills rejoice on every side:” and the green places shout for joy, yea also sing, Psa. lxv. 9–13, as God makes the earth soft with showers, and blesses the springing thereof.

The object of this volume is, to exhibit what these conditions are ; and in doing so, there will be both opportunity and necessity to offer some explanation of the functions to which they are thus essential. It will now be attempted to give a general idea of the functions upon which the health of the whole body immediately depends ; some of them will afterwards receive additional notice. As we live by turning what we eat into our own substance, we have organs for receiving, masticating, and swallowing food, in our lips, teeth, tongue, and the other parts which convey the morsel into the stomach. Some of these, it is true, are used for other purposes, as that of articulate speech, economy of means in the production of various ends being frequently exemplified in our bodily structures. The swallowed food is subjected to various processes in the stomach and alimentary canal, in which the liver, for instance, participates. By the combined effect of all the organs of diges 1() G00D HEALTH. tion and assimilation, the nutritious part of the food is changed into blood, and conveyed into its current; while that portion which is inca– pable of such conversion is separated, and passes from the body. As it is out of blood that every structure of the body is maintained, there must be an apparatus to convey this “liquid flesh,” as it has been aptly termed, throughout the whole fabric; and the heart, like a force pump, propels it through the arteries and their subdivisions, which carry it along to pervade and animate all our organs. The veins receive the blood again from them, when it has served its purpose, and bring it back to the heart. But, as it returns to the heart deprived of what had fitted it to be the life of our bodies, and charged moreover with what renders it injurious to them, before it is again finally reissued from the heart, the blood undergoes another shorter circulation through the lungs, where it is exposed to the air, and the dark purple colour it has acquired in passing through the body, is changed to the bright scarlet, which characterizes it while it is being sent along the arteries, to penetrate and vivify all the bodily structures. What this change of colour accompanies and signifies, there will be fitter occasion to explain when speaking of the importance of pure air. It will then be seen, that we live on one of the constituents of the atmosphere, as well as on food. The difference between the living and the  GOOD HEALTH. 11 dead body may be thus stated:—While we are alive, decomposition is perpetually and proportionally accompanied by renewal; but, after death, decomposition proceeds uninterruptedly and

But it was in vain that he interfered; for she had made up her mind, and it was seldom that she changed her resolution after forming it. In the present instance, she told her son that she felt as strong in her cause as if she held in her hand the sword of gold which Jeremias gave to Judas; and some days afterwards she called at the house of Sir David Hamilton, and asked to see the young master. She was shewn into a room, where young Hamilton was sitting writing a thesis, with a view to becoming one of the faculty. On seeing her enter, his brow became clouded, for he knew her; and in an angry and even violent manner, he asked her what she wanted with him.

It was the Carnival ! ‘I do not mean to fatigue you with a regular detail of the ceremonies, which were observed when the Doge of Venice used to celebrate his marriage with the Ocean. You may read of these in books of travels, told in a manner that I cannot aspire to rival. I must be content with speaking of the general effect, as it related to myself. “I remember waking early in the morning, and from my window, which looked over the Adriatic sea, I saw the sun struggling onwards in a sea of vapor. His track appeared nearly in the point of Trieste. The waters of the gulf lay silent, stretching away south and north, a melancholy plain without life or motion. I began to augur ill of the Venetian festival, but I was agreeably disappointed. For in about an hour the god of day threw off his cloudy bondage, and looked out upon us like, what he really is in southern climates, the living wonder and paragon of the heavens. The wind began to stir and freshen, and the waves curled and broke along the shore. The distant mountains, which had before looked cold and mournful, awoke to a new life, and put on their richest colors. The people opened their windows, there was a hum of voices and laughing, and the splashing of water in the canals below. One after one, the little boats and gondolas shot out from creeks and corners, and shook their tiny streamers to the breeze; men and women, in new gay dresses, were seen; rowers and gondolieri, and holi 132 A DAY IN VENICE. day-making girls from the neighboring continent, while the servants seemed to go about blithely on their morning errands. It was clear that the day would be in our favor, and accordingly we prepared to do it honor, by displaying before the curious Venetian ladies some of the elegances of our English apparel. We had ordered a gondola to be ready early, and after we had taken our coffee, we descended to where it lay waiting our arrival. ‘The time appointed for the procession not having arrived, we bade the gondolieri row us through some of the different streets of the city, to witness the preparations that were making in all quarters from the Doge to the beggar. The English traveller who has not visited this corner of Italy, cannot have any idea of the delight of gliding along from street to street, by churches and palaces and marble houses, without an effort of his own. It is more like the motion which we enjoy (or seem to enjoy) in a dream than anything else. I lay on the soft cushions of the gondola, and from underneath the pleasant shadow which the curtains made, I looked up at the architectural splendors; at windows filled with eastern-looking women,

If we are to have battle, let it be between the two lovers who claim my hand. By the honour of a Mayor's daughter, I shall be his who gaineth the day ! Stand forward, Patrick Hume and Governor Wallace.” “Bravo!” shouted the burghers, delighted with a scheme that smacked so sweetly of justice and safety. All eyes were now turned on the Captain; and Isabel, delighted with her scheme, was seen concealing her face with the corner of her cloak, to suppress her laughter. Captain saw, however, neither justice nor safety in the scheme, and, edging near the Mayor, whispered into his ear his intention not to fight. Palpable indications of fear were escaping from his trembling limbs, and the hero of Bothwell was on the eve of being discovered. Hume was prepared— he stood, sword in hand, ready for the combat. “Come forward, Captain "" cried the Bastard. “Come forward I"" resounded from Isabel, and a hundred voices of the burghers. “I am the Governor of Berwick,” answered the hero, in a trembling voice, keeping the body of the Mayor between him and Hume. “As the servant of the King, I dare not” (panting) “run the risk of reducing my authority—by-byengaging, I say, by committing myself in single combat, like a knight errant, for a runaway damsel. It comporteth not with my dignity—hegh—hegh—I say, I cannot come down from the height of my glory at Bothwell, by committing myself in a love brawl. But ye are my men—hegh—hegh— ye are bound to fight when I command. Do your duty—on, on, I say, to the rescue.” “We want not the wench,” responded many voices. “He that will not fight for his love, deserves to lose her for his cowardice.” “Resign her, good Mayor,” cried others. “Give the damsel her choice,” added others. “Bravo, good fellows 1” cried Bell, in the midst of her laughter; and a shout from Hume's men rewarded her spirit. The enthuThe siasm was caught by the Berwickers, some of whom, observing certain indications thrown out by Isabel, ran forward and got from her a flagon of good wine. The vessel was handed from one to another. “Hurra for Hume !” shouted the Berwickers. The tables were turned. All, to a man, were with Isabel and her partner. The Mayor had sense enough to see his position. In any way he was to lose his daughter, and he heartily despised the coward that would not fight for his love. “Hume,” he cried, standing forward, “come hither; and, Isabel, approach the side of thy father.” The laughing damsel ran forward, and, perceiving her absolute safety, flung herself on her father's neck, and hung there, amidst the continued shouts of the men. “Forgive me, forgive me, father 1"" cried she. “My choice is"

The sun was hot, the mountain high, the path overgrown  A WISE CHILD 279 with cactus and other prickly plants, tangled with creepers and not devoid of snakes. Monkeys chattered, parrots screamed, glittering insects quivered like tinsel in the sun, or darted like flashes of coloured light across the forestshade. Vistas of beauty, such as he had never dreamed of, opened out on either side, and looking back more than once to take breath while he ascended, the deep blue sea lay spread out beneath him, rising broader and broader to meet the blue transparent sky. But Slap-Jack, truth to tell, was sadly indifferent to it all. Uneasiness of the legs sadly counteracted pleasure of the eye. It was with considerable gratification that he observed his leader diverge from the upward path, and rounding the shoulder of the hill, take a direction somewhat on the downward slope. Then he wiped his brows, with a sigh of relief, and asked audibly enough for something to drink. She seemed less afraid of observation now, although she did not comply with his request, but pointed downward to a dark hollow, from which ascended a thin, white, spiral line of smoke, the only sign denoting human habitation in the midst of this luxuriant wilderness of tropical growth and fragrance. Then, parting the branches with both hands, she dived into the thicket, to stop at the door of a hut, so artfully concealed amongst the dense luxuriant foliage that a man might have passed within five yards and never known it was there but for the smoke. Célandine closed the door cautiously behind her visitor, handed him a calabash of water, into which she poured some rum from a goodly stone jar—holding at least a gallon—watched him eagerly while he drank, and when he set the measure down, flung both arms round his neck, and kissing him all over the eyes and face, murmured in fondest accents— “Do you not know why I have brought you here? Do you not know who and what you are ?” “I could have told you half an hour back,” answered Slap-Jack, with a puzzled air, “but so many queer starts happen hereaway, mother, that I'm blessed if I can tell you now.” Tears shone in the fierce black eyes that never left his  280, CERISE face, but seemed to feast on its comeliness with the desire of a famished appetite for food. “Call me mother again l’’ exclaimed the Quadroon. “You called me mother down yonder at the store, and my heart leaped to hear the word. Sit ye down, my darling, there in the light, where I can see your innocent face. How like you are to your father, my boy. You've got his own bold eyes, and broad shoulders, and large, strong hands.

All this time I kept away from Miss Furnivall and Mrs. Stark, as much as ever I could; for I feared them—I knew no good could be about them, with their grey, hard faces, and their dreamy eyes, looking back into the ghastly years that  THE OLD NURSE'S STORY 139 were gone. But, even in my fear, I had a kind of pity for Miss Furnivall, at least. Those gone down to the pit can hardly have a more hopeless look than that which was ever on her face. At last I even got so sorry for her—who never said a word but what was quite forced from her—that I prayed for her; and I taught Miss Rosamond to pray for one who had done a deadly sin; but often when she came to those words, she would listen, and start up from her knees, and say, “I hear my little girl plaining and crying very sad—oh, let her in, or she will die!” One night—just after New Year's Day had come at last, and the long winter had taken a turn, as I hoped— I heard the west drawing-room bell ring three times, which was the signal for me. I would not leave Miss Rosamond alone, for all she was asleep—for the old lord had been playing wilder than ever—and I feared lest my darling should waken to hear the spectre child; see her I knew she could not. I had fastened the windows too well for that. So I took her out of her bed, and wrapped her up in such outer clothes as were most handy, and carried her down to the drawing-room, where the old ladies sat at their tapestry work as usual. They looked up when I came in, and Mrs. Stark asked, quite astounded, “Why did I bring Miss Rosamond there, out of her warm bed ?” I had begun to whisper, “Because I was afraid of her being tempted out while I was away, by the wild child in the snow,” when she stopped me short (with a glance at Miss Furnivall), and said Miss Furnivall wanted me to undo some work she had done wrong, and which neither of them could see to unpick. So I laid my pretty dear on the sofa, and sat  140 THE OLD NURSE'S STORY. * : down on a stool by them, and hardened my heart against them, as I heard the wind rising and howling. Miss Rosamond slept on sound, for all the wind blew so ; and Miss Furnivall said never a word, nor looked round when the gusts shook the windows. All at once she started up to her full height, and put up one hand, as if to bid us listen. “I hear voices !” said she. “I hear terrible screams —I hear my father's voice!” Just at that moment my darling wakened

A court martial was held at Portsmouth, and fortunately for him, was composed of officers of the highest distinction, so that the first men in his profession became thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances of his conduct. The enthusiasm with which his men bore testimony in his favour, was gratifying to his feelings, and the minutes of the evidence were most honourable to him. The Court pronounced, that Lieutenant Walsingham had done all that could be effected by the most gallant and judicious officer in the defence of his Majesty's ship Resolute. The ministry who had employed Captain Campbell were no longer in place, and one of the Lords of the Admiralty at this time happened to have had some personal quarrel with him. A few days after the trial, Walsingham was at a public dinner, at which Campbell's chaf 0  MANEUVRING, 189 racter became the subject of conversation, Walsingham was warned, in a whisper, that the first Lord of the Admiralty's private secretary was present, and was advised to be prudent ; but Walsingham's prudence was not of that sort, which can coolly hear a worthy man's memory damned with faint praise; his prudence was not of that sort; which can tamely sit by and see a friend's reputation in danger. With all the warmth and eloquence of friendship, he spoke in Captain Campbell's defence, and paid a just and energetic tribute of praise to his memory. He spoke, and not a word more was said against Canıpbell. The politicians looked down upon their plates, and there was a pause of that sort, which sometimes in a company of interested men of the world results from surprise at the imprudent honesty of a good natured novice.

To cajole it from her, so far as she knew it, had been no greater difficulty than it was to the fox to get the cheese from the crow : and while to him she was the errant unprotected young lady of large and tempting fortune, he could easily make himself appear to her the missing link in the pursuit. He could do what as a woman she could not accomplish, and what her brothers were not attempting. In that conviction, nay, even expecting her mother to be satisfied with his charms and his qualifications, she claimed that he might at least read the MS. of the book, assuring her mother that all she had intended the night before was to copy out the essentials for him. “To take the spirit and leave me the letter ? ” said Caroline. “O Janet, would not that have been worse than carrying off the book ?

This is (or rather was, for though it still exists, it is now much altered) a high, steep, and narrow bridge, having a portal, or gateway, in the centre, which the insurgents had shut and barricaded. About three hundred men were stationed to defend this important pass, under Rathillet, Balfour, and others. . They behaved well, and made a stout defence, till the soldiers of Mon mouth forced the pass at the point of the bayonet. The insurgents then gave way, and the royal army advanced towards the main body, who, according to the historian Burnet, seem neither to have had the grace to submit, the courage to fight, nor the sense to run away. They stood a few minutes in doubt and confusion, their native courage and enthusiasm frozen by the sense of discord amongst themselves, and the sudden approach of an army superior in discipline. At length, as the artillery began to play upon them, and the horse and Highlanders were about to charge, they gave way without resistance, and dispersed like a flock of sheep. The gentle-tempered Duke of Monmouth gave strict orders to afford quarter to all who asked it, and to make prisoners, but spare lives. Considerable slaughter, it is said, took place, notwithstanding his orders, partly owing to the unrelenting temper of Claverhouse, who was burning to obtain vengeance for the defeat of Drumclog, and the death of his kinsman, who was slain there,' and partly to the fury of the English soldiers and the Scottish Highlanders, who distinguished themselves by their cruelty. Four hundred men were killed at the battle of Bothwell bridge, and about twelve hundred made prisoners. These last were marched to Edinburgh, and imprisoned in the Greyfriars' churchyard, like cattle in a penfold, while several ministers and others were selected for execution. The rest, after long confinement there, and without any shelter save two or three miserable sheds, and such as they found in the tombs, were dismissed, upon giving bonds for conformity in future; the more obstinate were sent as slaves to the plantations. Many of the last were lost at sea. And yet, notwithstanding these disasters, the more remote consequences of the battle of Bothwell bridge were even more calamitous than those which were direct and immediate. 22d June, 1679.

Some benevolent friends had come forward to help the forlorn woman, and the boy had been sent to Germany, and the girl to a semi-charitable school for the rearing of officers' daughters; so they had struggled on somehow, until the boy was able to win a livelihood by his industry, and the girl old enough to go out as governess. The mother had a lodging somewhere in an obscure street on the Surrey side of the Thames, and here George used to return every evening when his office duties were over. The friendship between these two young men did not arise all in a moment. Philip Rayner was by no means impulsive, and George Tolson, though free and frank as the winds of heaven, was too proud to make the faintest advance towards the son of his employer. For some time these two behaved towards each other with a supreme reserve; but they were the only young men in the office, and little by little the ice melted, until acquaintance ripened into friend 148 A GOOD HATER. ship. They had few tastes in common. George Tolson was much more versatile, of a brighter and more joyous nature, than his master's son ; but they were both young, and that made a bond between them. Nor was this the only link. There were circumstances in George Tolson's life which awakened a keen interest in the mind of Philip. He had discovered that George was the chief support and devoted companion of his mother, and he envied him so tender a tie, so precious a duty. He used to walk home with George on summer evenings, now and then, and growing bolder and more familiar by slow degrees, would consent by and by to drop in upon the widow, and take a late cup of tea after his walk, or play a game of chess with George while the mother looked on. If he had possessed the power to help his friend in any substantial manner, he would have done it; but he was still in a state of tutelage, and Samuel Rayner thought he did quite enough in giving the young man a liberal salary. All that Philip could do was to testify his regard for the widow by such small gifts as he could afford for the embellishment of her scantily furnished lodging—a plated tea service—a new chessboard and men-a pair of china vases for the mantelpiece, and so on. They were trifling gifts, but very  A GOOD HATER. 149 precious to Mrs. Tolson, who had not been favoured by such tributes of late years. And so the years went on, with a quiet monotony which was pleasant enough to Philip, who had no yearning for change. He and George used to walk together a great deal in those long summer evenings, late into the autumn even, when lamps were flaming in the misty streets, or in the cold spring nights, when a great wind blustered in every

The warrior on this, and seeing a crowd collecting, retired slowly towards his village. One of the guard fired upon him, and he was mortally wounded. No inquiry was made, or at least no punishment inflicted on him who had committed the outrage. “All the revengeful feelings, natural to savages, were called up on the occasion. The Natchez flew to arms, and the French were assailed on every side, and many of them fell. The Stung Serpent, an influential chief, interposed his authority, and the slaughter ceased. A new treaty of peace was the result of the discussion that ensued, and the whole affair seemed to be buried in oblivion. “Soon after this, in the year 1723, under different pretexts, several hundred soldiers were secretly introduced into the settlement, and the defenceless and unsuspecting Natchez slaughtered in their huts. The head of the first chief was demanded as the price of peace, and the wretched Natchez were obliged to yield to the demand. The slaughter had continued four days, before peace was granted them. This was a deed, of course, never to be forgotten nor forgiven by the savages. They saw at once, that there now remained no alternative were 8  86 IIISTORY OF THE WESTERN STATES. between their own destruction or that of their enemies. They were moody, pensive, timid and slow; but they were sure in devising the means of vengeance. Things remained in this situation until 1729 At this time, M. de Chopart, who had been the chief agent in these transactions, and who was excessively obnoxious to the savages, had been ordered to New Orleans, to meet an investigation of his conduct touching this affair. The joy of the savages was great; for they hoped, at least, to be delivered from his enmity and oppression. To their despair, they learned that he was justified, and reinstated in his authority. He seemed, on his return, more vindictive towards them than ever. To manifest his ill feelings, he determined to build a town, two miles below the present site of Natchez, on ground occupied by a large and ancient village of the Indians. Accordingly, he sent for the Sun chief, and ordered him to have the savage huts cleared away, and the inhabitants dispersed. The chief replied, 'that their ancestors had dwelt there for ages; and that it was good that their descendants should dwell there after them.' The order was, repeated, with a threat of destruction, if not obeyed. “ The Indians dissembled ; and, remarking that the corn had just come out of the ground, and that their hens were laying their eggs, and that to abandon their village at that time would  HISTORY OF THE WESTERN STATES. 87 ance. bring famine both on them and

He pictured her dressed in some soft blue kind of gauze—the shimmering blue of water in the sunlight-and wearing white lilies at her breast and in her hair. He imagined her amidst scenes, formed partly from recollections of the Arabian Nights and partly from what he remembered of Thelwick Castle, dazzling with light and brilliant with flowers ; a crowd of beautiful ladies, and one stepping in amongst them, the queen of them all. Then he fancied music and dancing, and admiring cavaliers crowding round her, and begging for the favour of her hand in the dance, at least so they worded it in Mr. Burd's fancy. But she was refusing them all, in her majestic but courteous way. 'I am already engaged,' he supposed her to be saying, 'I must decline.' And then, oh wonder ! oh rapture !-Mr. Burd trembled as he imagined this part—he, Albert Burd, came forward, and she, this Queen Blanche, went to meet him and laid her hand on his arm, and she said, in her clear, kind voice, I have been waiting for you, Mr. Burd. And then, like most dreams, having reached a climax, this day-dream faded away, and a large cockchafer lumbered heavily in at the window and dropped into the milk-jug, whence Mr. Burd had to extract it carefully with a spoon. He set the dripping thing tenderly on the window-sill, and watched it shake its wet wings and then sail off into the dim sweet twilight beyond, which was as vague and unknown as the twilight of dreams and fancies where he himself had been wandering so happily.  194 A FELLOW-PASSENGER The first time that I met Mr. Algernon Read was on board a large steamer homeward bound. I was sitting with my two little sisters on deck, watching the cool awnings Aapping in the soft warm wind. The sea was violet and green, with far-away flakes of foam ; there was neither land nor yet a sail to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, save the measured creaking of the ship as she cleft her way through the rounded hollows and over the curled ridges of the iridescent water. My youngest sister, a child of ten, who had only lately recovered from low fever, complained of feeling tired and faint, and asked me to carry her down to her cabin. I took her up in my arms and tried to make my way to the stairs,' as we ignorantly called the companion’; but the ship was rolling, and I found it difficult to keep from falling. Presently a gentleman came up to me with a courteous bow, and before I could gainsay him he had taken Felicia gently out of my arms and had carried her to her cabin. But my heart smote me for letting him do it. He was about two-and-twenty, very small, with a delicate refined

A LOGICAL DEDUCTION. Doctor Ferrier had a most thorough contempt for every expression that savoured of cant, and often found fitting opportunities amongst his flock for touching the sore with his gentle caustic. The Doctor met with a serious fracture in one of his legs,—he had taken a carriage for the purpose of escorting a party of ladies, and on returning home to the neighbourhood of the Sneddon, just as the ladies had left the carriage, and the driver was folding up the steps and fastening the carriage door, a flash of lightning scared the horses, and off they started at their utmost speed, snorting and plunging. The Doctor, knowing that some loose stones had been laid down at a new building, in the street up which they were running, and thence calculating on the certainty of being overturned when they should come up to that point, leapt out from the carriage, which was the occasion of the accident above stated. The fractured limb took a considerable time to knit together, and gain sufficient strength, so as to enable it to take a share with its brother locomotive in out or in-door duties, and, in the interim, the inquiries and sympathies of his flock were unceasing.

Doctor Ferrior was once in a party of his brethren and a few of the Cameronian communion, going in one of the canal passage-boats, to join their respective Synods in Edinburgh, when there happened to be a passenger apparently much under the influence of ardent spirits. The manner, however, in which he was demeaning himself, showed that a considerable portion of his behaviour was put on, and drink the mask under which he chose to assail the clergymen.

The scene around me was wild and gloomy. A region arid and desolate stretched beside and behind me, shut in by steep inaccessible mountains, upon which no verdure bloomed.

As my sight became familiar with the darkness, I descried beyond the broad river a red twilight, as of distant fires glowing upon a  THE COUNT OF CASTEL VECCHIO. 161 sterile plain that stretched far away beyond my vision.

Then I beheld the faces of many of those shadows brighten, and the flames glowing less fiercely around them, while the black stains upon their forms waxed fainter.

And now I turned my eyes towards the wretched ones afar off, and, lo! a form, tall as a giant and black as a wintry tempest, stood beyond them, and the wail of their anguish swelled upon the air when they looked upon him.

Mrs. Pemberton had said that she was about to be visited by affliction-alluding, there was no doubt, to the probable death of Glenmurray-And was his fatė so certain that it was the theme of conversation at Richmond? Were only her eyes blind to the certainty of his danger ? On these ideas did Adeline chiefly dwell after the departure of her monitress; and in an agony unspeakable she entered the room where Glenmurray was sitting, in order to look at him, and form her own judgment on a subject of such importance. But, alas! she found him with the brilliant deceitfui appearance that attends his complaint-a bloom resembling health on his cheek, and a brightness in his eye rivalling that of the undimmed lustre of youth. 3 Surprised, 1  121 Surprised, delighted, and overcome by these appearances, which her inexperience rendered her incapable of appreciating justly, Adeline threw herself on the sofa by him; and, as she pressed her cold cheek to his glowing one, her tearful eye was raised to heaven with an expression of devout thankfulness. “ Mrs. Pemberton paid you a long vi. sit,"" said Glenmurray, “and I thought once, by the elevated tone of her voice, that she was preaching to you.' “ I believe she was,"" cheerfully replied Adeline, “and now I have a confession to make; the season of reserve shall be over, and I will tell you all the adventures of this day without evasion.' “ Aye, I thought you were not ingenuous with me this morning,” replied Glenmurray : “ but better late than never.""

Glenmurray sighed deeply as she concluded her narration. “I have only one request to make,"" said he-“ Never let that Mary come into my presence again ; and be sure to take care of Mrs. Pemberton's address."" Adeline promised that both his requests should be attended to. Mary was paid her wages, and dismissed immediately; and a girl being hired to supply her place, the ménage went on quietly again. But a new mortification awaited Glenmurray  129 murray and Adeline.

I did not run away, because he would not take me with him. The last time I saw him, which was only for a few minutes, he told me of the kindness which you had lately shown him, and said that though he could have acted the part of a villain formerly, now that you had proved yourself a friend in what appeared the extremity of his fortune, he could not, for a moment, think of robbing you of what he was pleased to call your greatest treasure; and that, rather than be the cause of giving you the smallest uneasiness, he would forever forego his own prospects of happiness."" “And what did you say to all this?"" again inquired the father, his passion gradually subsiding. “ Indeed, I was so struck with the nobleness of his sentiments, and the passionate earnestness with which he uttered them, that I could not say a word. And, besides, he did not give me time, for he hurried off, and left me to mourn his absence as I do now."" “What! is it possible that you really love him ?” exclaimed Mr. Hanson, in a half bantering, half angry tone. But now it was evident that his passion was working itself into a calm. “O father!” said Caroline, “need I answer you that question after what I have already told you ?” The next morning Caroline was summoned to her father's apartment, when he inquired, in the most affectionate manner, “if she thought George Hanson really loved her, or if it were not rather her fortune to which he was partial, notwithstandiny all his professions to the contrary."" “ As to that, my dear father,” said she, “I can have little  184 TALES OF THE SCOTTISH PEASANTRY. doubt; for, setting aside the circumstance of my fortune being in your disposal, while he was here, a letter from the young and beautiful widow of the late Mr. Mowbray, whose fortune would more than double mine, even if I were to marry with your approbation, fell into my hands. It was addressed to him. Some irresistible impulse prompted me to read it, and from the tenor of that letter, it was evident he needed only to make a proposal to be accepted.” Mr. Hanson, after a short pause, resumed, “I have been thinking a good deal about the matter, and I believe I must write him an invitation to come and spend a few days more with us as soon as he can find it convenient.” George Hanson was not long in returning, and the result was—what the reader has perhaps already anticipated,—a marriage.

The next morning they saw a dignified, elderly gentleman with ten unarmed followers coming down towards the shore. Hailing the sloop, the older gentleman, speaking Gaelic, asked who and whence they were, and being told, invited them ashore as his guests. They went on shore, well armed; and he embraced them one by one, telling them that they were the happiest sight that island had seen for hundreds of years ; that it was called Hy-Brasail or O-Brazile; that his ancestors had been princes  Kirwan's Search for Hy-Brasail 131 of it, but for many years it had been taken possession of by enchanters, who kept it almost always invisible, so that no ship came there; and that for the same reason he and his friends were rendered unable to answer the sailors, even when they knocked at the door; and that the enchantment must remain until a fire was kindled on the island by good Christians. This had been done the night before, and the terrible noises which they had heard were from the powers of darkness, which had now left the island forever. And indeed when the sailors were led to the castle, they saw that the chief tower had just been demolished by the powers of darkness, as they retreated; but there were sitting within the halls men and women of dignified appearance, who thanked them for the good service they had done. Then they were taken over the island, which proved to be some sixty miles long and thirty wide, abounding with horses, cattle, sheep, deer, rabbits, and birds, but without any swine; it had also rich mines of silver and gold, but few people, although there were ruins  132 Kirwan’s Search for Hy-Brasail of old towns and cities. The sailors, after being richly rewarded, were sent on board their vessel and furnished with sailing directions to their port. On reaching home, they showed to the minister of their town the pieces of gold and silver that were given them at the island, these being of an ancient stamp, somewhat rusty yet of pure gold; and there was at once an eager desire on the part of certain of the townsmen to go with them. Within a week an expedition was fitted out, containing several godly ministers, who wished to visit and discover the inhabitants of the island; but through some mishap of the seas this expedition was never heard of again. Partly for this reason and partly because none of Captain Nesbit's crew wished to return to the island, there came to be in time a feeling of distrust about all this rediscovery of HyBrasail or 0-Brazile. There were not wanting those who held that the ancient gold pieces might have been gained by piracy, such as was beginning to be known upon the Spanish main ; and as for the boy Kirwan, some of

She broke her purpose to Mr. Rigby, that she might gain not only his adhesion to her views, but his assistance in achieving them. As Madame Colonna, in Mr. Rigby's estimation, exercised more influence over Lord Monmouth than any other individual, faithful to his policy or practice, he agreed with all Madame Colonna's plans and wishes, and volunteered instantly to further them. As for the Prince, his wife never consulted him on any subject, nor did he wish to be consulted. On the contrary, he had no opinion about anything. All that he required was that he should be surrounded by what contributed to his personal enjoyment, that he should never be troubled, and that he should have billiards. He was not inexpert in field-sports, rode indeed very well for an Italian, but he never cared to be out-of-doors ; and there was only one room in the interior which passionately interested him. It was where the echoing balls denoted the sweeping hazard or the effective cannonade. That was the chamber where the Prince Colonna literally existed. Half-an-hour after breakfast he was in the billiard-room ; he never quitted it until he dressed for dinner; and he generally contrived, while the world were amused or amusing themselves at the comedy or in the dance, to steal down with some congenial sprites to the magical and illumined chamber, and use his cue until bedtime. Faithful to her first impressions, Lucretia had made no difference in her demeanour to Coningsby to that which she offered to the other guests. Polite, but uncommunica 247 tive; ready to answer, but never originating conversation ; she charmed him as little by her manner as by her person ; and after some attempts, not very painstaking, to interest her, Coningsby had ceased to address her. The day passed by with only a faint recognition between them ; even that sometimes omitted. When, however, Lucretia observed that Coningsby had become one of the most notable persons in the Castle; when she heard everywhere of his talents and accomplishments, his beauty and grace and great acquirements, and perceived that he was courted by all; that Lord Monmouth omitted no occasion publicly to evince towards him his regard and consideration ; that he seemed generally looked upon in the light of his grandfather's heir; and that Lady St. Julians, more learned in that respect than any lady in the kingdom, was heard more than once to regret that she had not brought another daughter with her, Clara Isabella, as well as Augustina ; the Princess Lucretia began to imagine that Madame Colonna, after all, might not be so extravagant in her purpose as she had first supposed. She, therefore, surprised Coningsby with the almost affectionate moroseness with which, while she hated to sing, she yet found pleasure in singing for him alone. And it is impossible to say what

It was a singularly romantic spot, but now well known to them all there, for they had visited it over and over again that morning. “In there,” said Danny Lund, keeping well behind Morton's body, and pointing at the same time to a cavern high up among the rocks, but quite on the opposite side of the little inlet of the sea. The mouth of the cavern was not twenty yards from  AARON TROW. 205 where they stood, but at the first sight it seemed as though it must be impossible to reach it. The precipice on the brink of which they all now stood, ran down sheer into the sea, and the fall from the mouth of the cavern on the other side was as steep. But Danny solved the mystery by pointing upwards, and show, ing them how he had been used to climb to a projecting rock over their heads, and from thence creep round by certain vantages of the stone till he was able to let himself down into the aperture. But now, at the present moment, he was unwilling to make essay of his prowess is a cragsman. He had, he said, been up on that projecting rock thrice, and there had seen the eyes moving in the cavern. He was quite sure of that fact of the pair of eyes, and declined to ascend the rock again. Traces soon became visible to them by which they knew that some one had passed in and out of the cavern recently. The stone, when examined, bore those marks of friction which passage and repassage over it will always give. At the spot from whence the climber left the platform and commenced his ascent, the side of the stone had been rubber by the close friction of a man's body. A light boy like Danny Lund might find his way in and out without leaving such marks behind him, but no heavy man could do so. Thus before long they all were satisfied that Aaron Trow was in the cavern before them. Then there was a long consultation as to what they would do to carry on the hunt, and how they would drive the tiger from his lair. That he should not again come out, except to fall into their hands, was to all of them a matter of course. They would keep watch, and ward there, though it might be for days and nights. But that was a process which did not satisfy Morton, and did not indeed well satisfy any of them. It was not only that they desired to inflict punishment on the miscreant in accordance with the law, but also that they did not desire that the miserable man should die in a hole like a starved dog, and that then they should go after him to take out his wretched skeleton.

There is, for example, the famous Sir Lucius O'Trigger of Sheridan, at whose humours we all laugh de. lightfully. He is the most real character, in all that strange company of profligates and swindlers who people Sheridan's plays, and I think the most profoundly dismal of all. The poor Irish knight's jokes are only on the surface. He is a hypocrite all through the comedy, and his fun no more real than his Irish estate. He makes others laugh, but he does not laugh himself, as Falstaff does, and Sydney Smith, and a few other hearty humorists of the British sort. So when he reads in the “Opinions of the Press” how the provincial journalists are affected with Mr. Lever's books; how the Doncaster Argus declares, “We have literally roared with laughter over the last number of Our Mess';” or the Manx Mercury vows it has “absolutely burst with cachinnation” over the facetiæ of friend Harry Lorrequer; or the Bungay Beacon has been obliged to call in two printer's devils to hold the editorial sides while perusing “Charles O'Malley's ” funny stories ; let the reader be assured that he has fallen upon critical opinions not worth the having. It is impossible to yell with laughter through thirtytwo pages. Laughter, to be worth having, can only come by fits and now and then. The main body of your laughter-inspiring book must be calm ; and if we may be allowed to give an opinion about Lorrequer after all that has been said for and against him, after the characteristics of boundless merriment which the English critic has found in him, and the abuse which the Irish writers have hurled at him for presenting degrading pictures of the national character, it would be to enter a calm protest against both opinions, and say that the author's characteristic is not humour, but sentiment,--neither more nor less than sentiinent, in spite of all the 13 2 0  402 CRITICAL REVIEWS rollicking and bawling, and the songs of Micky Free, and the horse-racing, and punch-making, and charging, and steeplechasingthe quality of the Lorrequer stories seems to me to be extreme delicacy, sweetness, and kindliness of heart. The spirits are for the most part artificial; the fond is sadness, as appears to me to be that of most Irish writing and people. Certain Irish critics will rise up in arms against this dictum, and will fall foul of the author of the paradox and of the subject of these present remarks too. For while we have been almost universal in our praise of Lorrequer in England, no man has been more fiercely buffeted in his own country, Mr. O'Connell himself taking the lead to attack this kindly and gentle writer, and thundering out abuse at him from his cathedra in the Corn Exchange.

FREDERICK the Second, king of Prussia, after his conquest of Saxony, transported, it is said, * by force, several manufacturers from Dresden to Berlin, where he was very desirous of establishing the manufacture of china. These unfortunate people, separated from their friends, their home, and their native country, were compelled to continue their labours for the profit and for the glory of their conqueror. Amongst the number of those sufferers was Sophia Mansfeld. She was young, handsome, and possessed considerable talents. Several pieces of porcelain of her design and modelling were shown to Frederick, when he visited the manufactory at Meissen, in Saxony; and their taste and workmanship appeared to him so exquisite, that he determined to transport the artist to his capital. But from the time of her arrival at Berlin, Sophia Mansfeld's genius seemed to forsake her. It was her business to sketch designs, and to paint them * Vide Wraxall's Memoirs of the Court of Berlin.  168 THE PRUSSIAN VASE. on the porcelain ; but either she could not or would not execute these with her former elegance: the figures were awkward and spiritless, and it was in vain that the overseer of the works attempted to rouse her to exertion ; she would sit for hours, with her pencil in her hand, in a sort of reverie. It was melancholy to see her. The overseer had compassion upon her ; but his compassion was not so great as his dread of the king's displeasure ; and he at length declared, that the next time Frederick visited the works, he must complain of her obstinate idleness. The monarch was expected in a few days; for, in the midst of his various occupations, Frederick, who was at this time extremely intent upon the establishment of the porcelain manufactory at Berlin, found leisure frequently to inspect it in person. The king, however, was prevented from coming at the appointed hour by a review at Potzdam. His majesty had formed the singular project of embodying, and training to the science of arms, the Jews in his dominions.* They were rather awkward in learning the manual exercise; and the Jewish review, though it afforded infinite amusement to the spectators, put Frederick so much out of humour, that, as soon as it was over, he rode to his palace of Sans Souci,

Love as it is felt in young and innocent hearts was to them the inexhaustible theme of ridicule, and the existence of female virtue they considered entitled to the same degree of credit as that of the Phoenix. While they confined themselves, however, to general and sweeping assertions, their opinions had little or no influence upon me; but when these were backed by a multitude of corroborative facts and particular examples of dereliction from virtue, with which their own evil experience had supplied them, my mind insensibly but strongly imbibed the poison of their principles, of which the baneful effects soon became evident, and I began to repent of my vows to the fond confiding girl who had given me her heart. “ For a considerable time I had combated opinions which I saw, if generally received, must be utterly subversive of the social charities; but the fiend of suspicion, once fairly roused, could not be  164 THE PARTING AND RETURN; laid, and shook, like an earthquake, the peace of my once unsuspecting heart. “ Hitherto my correspondence with Emma had been both frequent and regular; but now, although I still duly received her letters, my replies became gradually colder, then less punctual, and at last ceased altogether.

Down among the rocks they all went, silently, Caleb Morton leading the way, and Danny Lund directing him from behind. “Mr. Morton, ,"" said an elderly man from St. George, “had you not better let the warders of the gaol go first; he is a desperate man, and they will best understand his ways?” In answer to this Morton said nothing, but he would let no one put a foot before him. He still pressed forward among the rocks, and at last came to a spot from whence he might have sprung at one leap into the ocean. It was a broken cranny on the sea-shore into which the sea beat, and surrounded on every side but the one by huge broken fragments of stone, which at first sight seemed as though they would have admitted of a path down among them to the water's edge; but which, when scanned more closely, were seen to be so large in size, that no man could climb from one to another. It was a singularly romantic spot, but now well known to them all there, for they had visited it over and over again that morning. “In there,” said Danny Lund, keeping well behind Morton's body, and pointing at the same time to a cavern high up among the rocks, but quite on the opposite side of the little inlet of the The mouth of the cavern was pot twenty yards from 1 ! 1 sea.

The precipice on the brink of which they all now stood, ran down sheer into the sea, and the fall from the mouth of the caveri on the other side was as steep. But Danny solved the mystery by pointing upwards, and show, ing them how he had been used to climb to a projecting rock over their heads, and from thence creep round by certain vantages of the stone till he was able to let himself down into the aperture. But now, at the present moment, he was unwilling to make essay of his prowess as a cragsman. He had, he said, been up on that projecting rock thrice, and there had seen the eyes moving in the cavern. He was quite sure of that fact of the pair of eyes, and declined to ascend the rock again. Traces soon became visible to them by which they knew that some one had passed in and out of the cavern recently. The stone, when examined, bore those marks of friction which passage and repassage over it will always give. At the spot from whence the climber left the platform"

Take my advice—dont be led away by foreigners, and trust to your own Government and your own officers. They have always dealt out justice, and will again.' Here Mr. Bagstock, who had been an unwilling participator in the inconveniences of the bivouac, anticipating even yet more undesirable experiences, impatiently broke in, shouting to supplement practically and effectively his superior officer's speech. 'Look here, m-m-m-en,' he said • 'w-w-w-hat's the use of all this m-m-mummery? it's b-b-beastly cold, this w-w-watching, I can t-t-tell you!

A tremendous burst of laughter followed this proposition, made with the greatest coolness and apparent earnestness, joined with cries of— 'Well done you, Mr. Bagstock, you stay and stick to your papers. We won't touch a hair of your head,' etc. The point of the joke, however, which was that Mr. Bagstock received a fee for each act of registration, and that in this hour of danger he had been sufficiently wide awake to his own interests to suggest the registration of a revolutionary mob at half a crown a head, so tickled the more humorous spirits that their infectious mirth went far to divert the rioters from their stern purposes. Even the iron-visaged police troopers could scarcely control their features, albeit under the terrible eye of Mr. Merlin. The sergeant stared fiercely at an adjacent gum-tree, while the Commissioner slapped Mr. Bagstock jocularly on the back, and declared he would rise in the Civil Service, to which he was an honour and an ornament. This ludicrous contretemps, joined with the sensible address of the Commissioner, whom all respected and believed, nearly had the effect of allaying irritation and sending most of the men back to their homes. But exorcists of all lands, since the world's dimmest eld, have ever found the fiend more easy to invoke than to lay. So it was in the present state of matters. All the worst characters in the various mining camps were now gathered together.

Story of Little Simpleton. 173 They returned home late, and told their father,—“The Simpleton is lost; she ran away from us in the forest; we searched, but could not find her anywhere. The wolves must have eaten her.” The peasant regretted the loss of his daughter bitterly; for although so simple she was still his child. The wicked sisters also shed tears. Her father put the little silver plate and the little apple into a box, and locked them up. Next morning a shepherd was tending his sheep near the place, playing on his pipe, and searching in the forest for one of his flock that was missing. He observed the little grave under the birch-tree; it was covered by the most lovely flowers, and out of the middle of the grave there grew a reed. The shepherd cut off the reed, and made a pipe of it. As soon as the pipe was prepared, oh, wonderful ! it began to play of itself, and say, “ Play, oh pipe, play! and comfort my poor parents and sisters. I was killed for the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple.” When the people heard of this they ran out of their huts, and all came round the shepherd and began to ask him who was killed. “Good people,” answered the shepherd, “I don't know who it is. While searching for one of my sheep in the  174 Slavonic Fairy Tales. forest, I came upon a grame covered with flowers. Above them all stood a reed. I cut off the reed and made this pipe of it.

Comfort my poor father and mother. I was killed for the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple.” The peasant asked the shepherd to take him to the place where he had cut the reed. They all went into the forest, saw the grave, and were astonished at the sight of the lovely flowers which grew there. They opened the grave, and there discovered the body of a girl, which the poor man recognised as that of his youngest daughter. There she lay, murdered—but by whom no one could tell. The people asked one another who it was that had killed the poor girl. Suddenly the pipe began to play,“Oh, my dearest father! my sisters brought me to this forest, and here killed me for the sake of my little plate and my little apple. You will not brirg me"

I was not perfectly sure that I had effected a lodgment in the young lady's heart ; and, to tell the truth, the   aunt overdid her part, and was a little too extravagant in   her liking of me. I knew that maiden aunts were not to   be captivated by the mere personal merits of their nieces'   admirers ; and I wanted to ascertain how much of all this   favor I owed to driving an equipage, and having great expectations.

They were   soon after closely besieged by their Indian enemies,   and all perished but seven or eight.     In August of the year 1687, Colonel Dongan, the   New York governor, met the sachems of the Five Nations at Albany, and confirmed the English alliance   with them by presents and speeches. In the spring of   the next year, a party of Onondaga Indians (one of   these five tribes) surprised a few French soldiers near   Fort Frontenac. Instead of murdering them, how HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE STATES. 79     ever, they confined them to hard labor (as a return for   the fate of those thirteen Indians whom the French had   sent to labor in old France). Lamberville, a French   priest, used his utmost skill to regain them ; but finding his efforts fruitless, he gave the Onondagas two   wampum-belts, to secure their kindness to the   prisoners, and prevent their joining the Senecas in   open war.     A treaty was formally made, this season, between   the French and the Five Nations ; but it was soon   interrupted by a singular event. The Dinondadie   Indians, who lived on the river St. Lawrence, had   lately begun to trade with the English, and their   friendship was, therefore, suspected by the French.   Adario, their chief sachem, now undertook to regain   the confidence of the latter nation, by performing   some notable exploit against their old enemies, the   Five Nations. He wished also to prevent a peace   between these two parties ; for, in that case, the   French would have leisure to punish the Dinondadies, and would stand no longer in awe of the Five   Nations. He determined, therefore, to make a difficulty between the two parties.     He put himself at the head of one hundred   Dinondadies, and lay in ambush for the ambassadors   of the Five Nations, at the fall in Cadaracqui river,   as they were returning from Canada home. He   killed some, and took the rest prisoners. He told   the latter, that the French governor had informed   him that fifty warriors of the Five Nations were com 80 HISTORY OF THE MDDLE STATES.     ing that way, and advised him to fall upon them   without mercy. The ambassadors were amazed at   the perfidy of the governor, and frankly informed   Adario of the truce they had just settled with him.

CHAPTER II.     "" Religious man ! what God   By prophets, priests, evangelists revealed   Of sacred truth, he thankfully received,   And, by its light directed, went in search   Of more.""     In the beginning of August, 1822, the poet passed   his examinations before the United Associate Presbj'tery of Glasgow, as preHminary to his admission   to the Divinity Hall ; and on the first Wednesday   of that month entered on the regular duties of the   several classes.     The first homily which he delivered there, is   spoken of as a curious and remarkable production.   It was founded on Rom. v. 19. ""By one man's disobedience many were made sinners."" His mode   of discussion appears to have been singular, nay,   original. He departed out of the beaten track of   theological dissertation, and expatiated forcibly on   the evils growing out of the apostasy, on the whole   animal tribes and instincts. The interest, and indeed amusement of the class increased as he proceeded ; nor did they conceal their feelings, but   on the contrary, violated the order of the occasion   by bursts of laughter and exclamations of condemnation. The poet, however, was not to be silenced     188 LIFE OF POILOK.     by such a course of conduct ; but continued with   philosophic coolness to read the homily. Having   reached that part of the discourse in which he sought   to show what earth would have been, if the virus of   sin had not polluted it ; he appeared to grow more   energetic, and to rise in majesty and force according to the canons regarding the climax ; then elongated himself, and bending over the pulpit, with outstretched arm and look of indignation, exclaimed,   "" Had sin not entered our world, no idiot smile   would have gathered on the face of folly to put out   of countenance the man of worth."" Never, perhaps, before nor since, has there been such a rebuke   administered in that hall of learning. The faces of   the students were instantly crimsoned with shame,   and deep silence continued until he closed his homily with the significant language of Milton,     "" Fair patrimony   That I must leeve ye sons !""     It is needless to say that the class, as a whole, expressed their opinion freely concerning the homily.   "" It was bombast and nonsense."" The professor, however, took a different view of it. His criticism was   decidedly favourable. He approved of it. He said,  "

It   must be remembered that when these prophesies were   made Minneapolis and Duluth had no existence, and   Superior was the natural outlet of the St. Louis river   into Lake Superior, and had its land titles not been so   complicated when the railroad from St. Paul to the head   of the lakes was projected, there is no doubt Superior   would have been the terminus of the road; but it was   found to be almost impossible to procure title to any   land in Superior, on account of its having been sold by   the proprietors in undivided interests to parties all over     History of Minnesota. 197     the country, and it was situated in Wisconsin, so the railroad people procured the charter of the company to   make its northern terminus on the Minnesota side of   the harbor, where Duluth now stands, and founded that   town as the terminus of the road.

If he were of a curious temper, he would not rest till   he had informed himself whom every estate in the parish belonged to, what hands they had gone through,   how one man got this field by marrying an heiress, and   the other lost that meadow by a ruinous lawsuit. As   a man of spirit, he would feel delighted on hearing the   relation of the opposition made by an honest yeoman   to an overbearing rich man, on the subject of an accustomed pathway or right of common. If he should find   the town or village divided into parties he would take   some pains to trace the original cause of their dissension, and to find out, if possible, who had the right on   his side. Circumstances would often occur to excite   his attention. If he saw a bridge, he would ask when   and by whom it was built. If in digging in his garden   he should find utensils of a singular form and construction, or a pot of money with a stamp and legend quite   different from the common coin, he would be led to inquire when they were in use, and to whom they had   belonged. His curiosity would extend itself by degrees.   If a brook ran through the meadows, he would be   pleased to trace it till it swelled into a river, and the   river till it lost itself in the sea. He would be asking   whose seat he saw upon the edge of a distant forest,     70 ON THE USES OF HISTORY.     and what sort of country lay behind the range of hills   that bounded his utmost view. If any strangers came   to visit or reside in the place where he lived, he would   be questioning them about the country they came from,   their connections and alliances, and the remarkable   transactions that had taken place within their memory   or that of their parents. The answers to these questions would insensibly grow up into history, which, as   you see, does not originate in abstruse speculations, but   grows naturally out of our situation and relative connections. It gratifies a curiosity which all feel in some   degree, but which spreads and enlarges itself with the   cultivation of our powers, till at length it embraces the   whole globe which we inhabit.

The soft voice which thrills in on   Clara through the thunderous twilight, — which breathed at   her pillow at midnight, — which shrieked at her very ear as   she was making her way up the dark staircase, touches us   with the same horror that enveloped the haunted girl. The   face revealed to her in the flash of the lamp as she turns   wildly, ""every muscle tense, forehead and brow drawn into   vehement expression, lips stretched as in the act of shrieking, eyes emitting sparks,"" out-terrorizes a whole phalanx   of ghosts.

Edgar   Huntly, with its somnambulism, is not equally successful.   The first appearance of the sleep-walker is somewhat impressive. But this auspicious opening is a promise unfulfilled. Clithero's history and remorse are too absurd, and   after that the whole book resolves itself into a tale of Indian   adventure, which, indeed, in its prophecy of Cooper, is the   most interesting part of the story.     Arthur Mervyn, a story of the Yellow Fever Plague of   1798 in New York, gives ample scope for the growing interest in physical horrors which, as we have seen, is a characteristic of the School of Terror. Though Brown certainly   dwells far too much on this physical horror for its own sake,   he is yet eminently skilful, also, in using it justifiably for the   artistic enhancement of higher sensations. One striking   instance of his power in such combination is that in which   the apparition appears to Arthur as he stands alone in the   desolate chambers of a fever-smitten house from which all   the inhabitants have been removed for burial.

Raja Rasalu. NCE there lived a great Raja, whose name was Salabhan, and he had a Queen, by name Lona, who, though she wept and prayed at many a shrine, had never a child to gladden her eyes. After a long time, however, a son was promised to her. Queen Lona returned to the palace, and when the time for the birth of the promised son drew nigh, she inquired of three Jogis who came begging to her gate, what the child's fate would be, and the youngest of them answered and said, ""Oh, Queen! the child will be a boy, and he will live to be a great man. But for twelve years you must not look upon his face, for if either you or his father see it before the twelve years are past, you will surely die! This is what you must do; as soon as the child is born you must send him away to a cellar underneath the ground, and never let him see the light of day for twelve years. After they are over, he may come forth, bathe in the river, put on new clothes, and visit you. His name shall be Raja Rasalu, and he shall be known far and wide."" So, when a fair young Prince was in due time born into   Raja Rasalu 137 the world, his parents hid him away in an underground palace, with nurses, and servants, and everything else a King's son might desire. And with him they sent a young colt, born the same day, and sword, spear, and shield, against the day when Raja Rasalu should go forth into the world. So there the child lived, playing with his colt, and talking to his parrot, while the nurses taught him all things needful for a King's son to know. Young Rasalu lived on, far from the light of day, for eleven long years, growing tall and strong, yet contented to remain playing with his colt, and talking to his parrot; but when the twelfth year began, the lad's heart leapt up with desire for change, and he loved to listen to the sounds of life which came to him in his palace-prison from the outside world.

SOME years after the last chapter was written I had some letters from Captain Adam, dated from Isle Pleasant, the name that had been given to the settlement. He had carried out his plan of returning to the island, taking with him a steamengine, some spinning-jennies, and looms for weaving, besides a large collection of books, cutlery, and other articles. He was accompanied by two engineers, and by six Lancashire factory  111.] 53 ISLE PLEASANT. women. Captain Adam was very confident that the latter would be able to produce a cloth from the plantain fibre very superior to any that had been made with the rough machinery and unskilled labour of the first inhabitants of Isle Pleasant; and he also was very certain that the engineers would be very valuable additions to the community. On arriving at the island he found that great progress had been made in a variety of ways during his absence. The most striking change that had been made was the introduction of the use of money. As the way in which it had been introduced was rather curious, it shall be described. The Pleasant people, as they liked to call themselves, had long been grumbling at the inconvenience of carrying out a great number of exchanges by means of barter; the man who had a basket of plantains to dispose of, and who wished to obtain in exchange a knitted jersey, would find perhaps that Mrs. Collins, the woman who was the best hand at making these jerseys, had more plantains already in stock than she expected to want for the next four months, and  54 [111. TALES İN POLITICAL ECONOMY. that although she would be quite willing to give a jersey in exchange for an ironing-board and a washtub, she would not give anything at all for an unnecessary addition to her stock of plantains. Now, if they used money, this inconvenience would be completely avoided; the man who had the plantains would sell them for money to whoever happened to want them; he would go with the money in his hand to Mrs. Collins, and buy the jersey that he wished

He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence of his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he had habituated them. Amid the confusion of a general election, no unimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to an isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements of political parties might have detected in these public declarations some intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that has unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this country. It.was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting down Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors of the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express arrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph. Coningsby was walking up Pall Mall. He was going to dine at the Oxford and Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his name, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or Cambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former fashionable acquaintances. He lighted in his walk on Mr. Tadpole and Mr. Taper, both of whom he knew. The latter did Hot notice him, but Mr. Tadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by a slight expression of coarse pity. Coningsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where he learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst denouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several thousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown danger, now first introduced to their notice. Being true Englishmen, they were all against Buckhurst's opponent, who was of the Venetian party, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities. Coningsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter brought up a third edition of the ""Sun,"" with electioneering bulletins from the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour.

The grooms, under the guidance of the shepherd-boy, took the horses towards the shore; where, at the distance of a mile, was a tighleana, or house of reception, opposite to which, stood a second ferry.

The intricacies of the mountain passes, which led to it by land, had probably saved it from the spoliations of Cromwell's soldiery; though the ferocious fanatics had penetrated into the deepest gorges of the Galway mountains, wherever momastic establishments had held out the lure of plunder.” The curiously-ribbed oak-roof of the church, with its arched and ornamented entrance of the Saxon Gothic, its great window perfectin its delicate tracery, and recently filled with stained glass, together with its belfry and cloisters, were in the highest preservation; while, lying * Not very far from Moycullen, at Aughnanure, twentyseven priests were put to death by the Cromwellites. - - -  THE o'FLAHERTYs. 185 partly in ruin, were still visible the old refectory, chauntry and cells of its once opulent community; and a modern building, which harmonized externally with the rest, had been built by the late Count O'Flaherty, and was now the residence (according to the ferryman who served as cicerone to the party) of the religious ladies of the Abbey.

The Jew and the captain of the Lively Peggy were now left in the hands of the law. The sailor was properly rewarded. Mr. Russell was engaged to superintend the education of Holloway. He succeeded, and was presented by the alderman with a living in Surrey. Mr. Supine never visited Italy, and did not meet with any consolation but in his German flute. Howard continued eager to improve himself; nor did he imagine that, the moment he left school, and parted from his tutor, his education was finished, and that his books were, “ like past misfortunes,” good for nothing but to be forgotten. His love for literature he found one of the first pleasures of his life; nor did he, after he came into the possession of a large fortune, find that his habits of constant occupation lessened his enjoyments, for he was never known to yawn at a window upon a rainy morning!

But from the hour of Seldon's communication, Walter's impatience to be at St Hilaire became so ungovernable, that finding his friend (Mr was again to be the companion of his journey) not unwilling to accompany him immediately, he obtained the necessary furlough, although it yet wanted nearly three weeks of the prescribed year's expiration; and although he had just despatched a letter to the lady of his love, full of anticipation, relating only to that period, he was on his way to the place of embarkation before that letter had reached French ground, and arrived at Caen (though travelling, to accommodate his friend, by a circuitous route) but a few days after its reception at St Hilaire.

The provoking banker mentioned it to her ladyship just after he had disappointed her of certain moneys, for which she was negotiating. From her situation and means of obtaining secret and early intelligence, she had it frequently in her power to make money by selling in or out of the stocks. Such an opportunity at present occurred; and “it was a great pity,” Mrs. Vickars observed, “ that the want of a little ready money should preclude her from the possibility of profiting by her situation.” Miss Turnbull, who was not deficient in quickness of comprehension, upon this hint immediately said, “that her ladyship might command some thousands which she had in Sir Thomas Stock’s bank.” Lady Pierrepoint the next day found that it would be best to hush up the affair of the subscription to the fatal pamphlet. She said, “that she had with infinite satisfaction ascertained, that the thing had not been noticed in the quarter where she feared it would have created an insuperable prejudice that there were other Turnbulls, as she was happy to understand, in the world, besides Mrs. Vickars's friend; and that as, in the list of subscribers, she was mentioned only as Miss Turnbull, not as Almeria Turnbull, all was safe, and nobody would suspect that a lady presented at court by my Lady Pierrepoint could be the same person that subscribed to a book of such a description.” This affair being adjusted, the league was tacitly formed between interest and vanity. Miss Turnbull was presented at court by Lady Pierrepoint, and her ladyship bought into the stocks with the Yorkshire heiress's money. The gratification of Almeria's ambition, however, did not complete her happiness. When she was at the summit of the Alps of fashion, she saw how little was to be seen.

After this the whole ship's company went ashore, except one left in charge, and they wandered about for hours, yet saw nothing more. As night came on they made a fire at the base of a fallen oak, near the shore, and lay around it, talking, and smoking the lately discovered weed, tobacco; when suddenly they heard loud noises from the direction of the castle and then all over the island, which frightened them so that they went on board the sloop and stayed all night. The next morning they saw a dignified, elderly gentleman with ten unarmed followers coming down towards the shore. Hailing the sloop, the older gentleman, speaking Gaelic, asked who and whence they were, and being told, invited them ashore as his guests. They went on shore, well armed; and he embraced them one by one, telling them that they were the happiest sight that island had seen for hundreds of years; that it was called Hy-Brasail or O-Brazile; that his ancestors had been princes  Kirwan's Search for Hy-Brasail 131 of it, but for many years it had been taken possession of by enchanters, who kept it almost always invisible, so that no ship came there; and that for the same reason he and his friends were rendered unable to answer the sailors, even when they knocked at the door; and that the enchantment must remain until a fire was kindled on the island by good Christians. This had been done the night before, and the terrible noises which they had heard were from the powers of darkness, which had now left the island forever. And indeed when the sailors were led to the castle, they saw that the chief tower had just been demolished by the powers of darkness, as they retreated; but there were sitting within the halls men and women of dignified appearance, who thanked them for the good service they had done. Then they were taken over the island, which proved to be some sixty miles long and thirty wide, abounding with horses, cattle, sheep, deer, rabbits, and birds, but without any swine; it had also rich mines of silver and gold, but few people, although there were ruins  132 Kirwan's Search for Hy-Brasail of old towns and cities. The sailors, after being richly rewarded, were sent on board their vessel and furnished with sailing directions to their port. On reaching home, they showed to the minister of their town the pieces of gold and silver that were given them at the island, these being of an ancient stamp, somewhat rusty yet of pure gold; and there was at once an eager desire on the part of certain of the townsmen to go with them. Within a week an expedition was fitted out, containing several godly ministers, who wished to visit and discover the inhabitants of the island; but through some mishap of the seas this expedition was never

A cathedral, with its dependencies and regulations, presents a picture of other times, and of a different order of things. It is a rich relic of a more poetical age. There still linger about it the silence and solemnity of the cloister. In the present instance especially, where the cathedral was large, and the town small, its influence was the more apparent. The solemn pomp of the service, performed twice a day, with the grand intonations of the organ, and the voices of the choir swelling through the magnificent pile, diffused, as it were, a perpetual Sabbath over the place. This routine of solemn ceremony continually going on, independent, as it were, of the world; this daily offering of melody and praise, ascending like incense from the altar, had a powerful effect upon my i magi nation. The aunt introduced me to her coterie, formed of families connected with the cathedral, and others of moderate fortune, but high respectability, who had nestled themselves under the wings of the cathedral to enjoy good society at moderate expense. It was a highly aristocratic little circle; scrupulous in its intercourse with others, and jealously cautious about admitting anything common or unclean. It seemed as if the courtesies of the old school had taken refuge here. There were continual interchanges of civilities, and of small presents of fruits and delicacies, and of complimentary crow-quill billets; for in a quiet, well-bred community like this, living entirely at ease, little duties, and little amusements, and little civilities, filled up the day. I have seen, in the midst of a warm day, a corpulent, powdered footman, issuing from the iron gateway of a stately mansion, and traversing the little place with an air of mighty import, bearing a small tart on a large silver salver. Their evening amusements were sober and primitive. They assembled at a moderate hour; the young ladies played music, and the old ladies, whist; and at an early hour they dispersed. There was no parade on these social occasions. Two or three old sedan chairs were in constant activity, though the greater part made their exit in clogs  BUCKTHORNE 195 and pattens, with a footman or waiting-maid carrying a lantern in advance; and long before midnight the clank of pattens and gleam of lanterns about the quiet little place, told that the evening party had dissolved. Still I did not feel myself altogether so much at my ease as I had anticipated considering the smallness of the place. I found it"

Always one priest, often five or six priests attend these funerals; each priest repeats a mass, for which he is paid sometimes a shilling, sometimes half a crown, sometimes half a guinea, or a guinea, according to the circumstances, or as they say, according to the ability of the deceased. After the burial of any very poor man who has left a widow or children, the priest Irakes what is called a collection for the widow ; he goes round to every person present, and each contributes sixpence or a shilling, or what they please. The reader will find in the 119te:  GIL OSSA R Y, xxi note upon the word Wake more particulars respecting the conclusion of the Irish funerals. Certain old women, who cry particularly loud and well, are in great request, and, as a man said to the Editor, “Every one would wish and “ be proud to have such at his funeral, or at “ that of his friends.” The lower Irish are wonderfully eager to attend the funerals of their friends and relations, and they make their relationships branch out to a great extent. The proof that a poor man has been well beloved during his life, is his having a crowded funeral. To attend a neighbour's funeral is a cheap proof of humanity, but it does not, as some imagine, cost nothing. The time spent in attending funerals may be safely valued at half a million to the Irish nation : the Editor thinks that double that sum would not be too high an estimate. The habits of profligacy and drunkenness which are acquired at wakes are here put out of the question. When a labourer, a carpenter, or a Smith is not at his work, which frequently happens, ask where he is gone, and ten to one the answer is—“Oh faith, please your honor, he “ couldn’t do a stroke to-day, for he's gone to “ the funeral,” b 3 Even  xxii G L OSS AR Y. Even beggars, when they grow old, go about begging for their own funeral: ; that is, begging for money to buy a coffin, candles, pipes and tobacco.—For the use of the candles, pipes and tobacco, see Wake. Those who value customs in proportion to their antiquity, and nations in proportion to their adherence to antient customs, will doubtless admire the Irish Ullaloo, and the Irish nation, for persevering in this usage from time immemorial. The Editor, however, has observed some alarming symptoms, which seem to prognosticate the declining taste for the Ullaloo in Ireland. In a comic

The squadron of the republic of Chile, commanded by Vice Admiral Lord Cochrane, rode triumphant in the South Pacific, in which no hostile ship then shewed a pennant, except the Spanish frigates LaPrueba, and LaVenganza. These were mere fugitives, concealing themselves in the ports on the coast of Guatemála and Mexico; for they were neither of force to cope with the Chilémo fleet, nor had they men, stores, nor provisions sufficient to enable them to return to Europe, or even to make their escape to the Manila. The Guayaquiléſios, therefore, considered themselves, perfectly secure from any interruption by sea; and had no cause to dread any attacks by land, for the Spanish army was sufficiently employed in defending the roads to Quito, through Patia from Popayan, and through Cüenca from Truxillo. Bolívar, on being apprised of this event, determined on sending a force by sea to Guayaquil ; for the purpose either of co-operating with the new republic against the common enemy, or of advancing from thence, unassisted, towards Quito, by the road of Chimborázo and Pichincha. The command of this expedition was given to Sucre. On his return, with the defeated army, to Popayan, he delivered it up to Gen. Torres, lately arrived there with the regiment of Bogotá, and some other troops from Santa Fe. Sucre then proceeded to Cali, where a new corps had been  CAMPAIGNS AND CRUISES. 231 raised in the valley of Caiica, consisting chiefly of black recruits, and called El Batallon de Santander, in compliment to the Vice-President of Colombia. Col. Mºlntosh, of the Albions, was appointed to discipline this regiment, with the assistance of four of his officers, * whom he selected to take with him from Popayan. Sucre left Cali with this corps, for the port of San Buenaventura on the coast of Chocó. where he proposed to embark for Guayaquil. The road, or rather track, from the valley of Caica, to the village of Las Juntas, (so called from two mountain torrents that meet there,) though not long, is excessively bad. The general mode of travelling, through the Montaña del Papagayo, and the hilly pass of Las Ojas, is on the shoulders of chasquis, or carriers. The recruits were much fatigued by this journey; during which the narrowness of the paths, and thickness of the underwood, rendered it difficult to detect them in their frequent attempts at desertion, in which they consequently often succeeded, They had learned that they were to be embarked, on arriving at San Buenaventura; and entertained such a horror of a sea voyage, that they were constantly endeavouring to escape. It, therefore, became necessary to order the few old soldiers, that

According to them, the form, smell, taste, colour, of anything are merely accidents, and might be changed without affecting the substance itself. See the excellent article on Substance in the Engl. Cyclopædia ; also that on Nominalists. According to Chaucer, then, the cooks who toil to satisfy man's appetite change the nature of the things cooked so effectually as to confound substance with accident. Translated into plain language, it means that those who partook of the meats so prepared, could not, by means of their taste and smell, form any precise idea as to what they were eating. The art is not lost. 1. 547. Haunteth, practises, indulges in ; cf. 1. 464. In the margin of MSS. E. and Hn. is written— Qui autem in deliciis est, viuens mortuus est. This is a quotation from the Vulgate version of i Tim. v. 6, but with Qui for quæ, and mortuus for mortua. 1. 549. In the margin of MSS. E. and Hn. is written—Luxuriosa res vinum, et contumeliosa ebrietas.' The Vulgate version of Prov. xx. I agrees with this nearly, but has tumultuosa for contumeliosa. This is of course the text to which Chaucer refers. And see note to B. 771. I. 554. He means that the drunkard's stertorous breathing seems to repeat the sound of the word Sampsoún. The word was probably chosen for the sake of its nasal sounds, to imitate a sort of grunt. Pronounce the m and n as in French, but with exaggerated emphasis. So also in l. 572.  154 NOTES TO GROUP C. 1. 555. See note to the Monkes Tale, Group B, line 3245. In Judges xiii. 4, 7, the command to drink no wine is addressed, not to Samson, but to his mother. Of Samson himself it is said that he was a Nazarite,' which implies the same thing; see Numbers vi. 3, 5. 1. 561. In Chaucer's Tale of Melibeus (Six-text, B. 2383) we find•Thou shalt also eschue the conseiling of folk that been dronkelewe ; for they can no conseil hyde; for Salomon seith, Ther is no priuetee ther-as regneth dronkenesse;' and see B. 776. The allusion is to Prov. xxxi. 4 - Noli regibus, O Lamuel, noli regibus dare uinum; quia nullum secretum est ubi regnat ebrietas.' This last clause is quite different from that in our own version; which furnishes, perhaps, a reason why the allusion here intended has not been perceived by previous editors. 1. 563.

And you happy little ones—you children, you darlings, one sees in your eyes full of innocence and joy of life, who brightly— the heaven of your childhood shines! ""In the autumn—when the leaves fall!"" said a physician to-day, half aloud to the Countess, after he had observed me with thoughtful mien, and had inquired after my health. This termination of life sounds quite romantic—but yet my life has had very little resemblance to a romance. Well then—in autumn!—in autumn. An aspen-leaf, which has trembled in the waving of so many winds—will tremble no longer! I make use of a remedy for my chest—may it or may it not be beneficial—I am calm; formerly I wished to die—now I wish it less, since I have learned better to support and employ life. I have learned to worship God in all his works. There is nothing, be it small as it may, to which a great thought does not in some way unite itself—and which thereby does not become important and interesting. The leaves fall—and I still live—and still lift joyfully my eyes to the gloomy heavens. I have great bodily pain—and yet suffer so little—my soul is so happy! ""In spring—when the leaves shoot!""—says the physician now. And I should almost believe it, if I ventured to listen to the quiet presentiment which abides in me, and which whispers to me; in spring, when everything awakens to life and to joy, when the flowers send forth from opened cups their fragrant odour to heaven—then will my emancipated spirit float forth and feel the air of the eternal spring; then will my yearning have reached its dimly divined of goal.

A dark fire was in his eye, and wrinkles which resembled those of discontent showed themselves sometimes on his brow, that formerly was so clear and smooth.

He is become a great man, but has ceased to be happy. His amiable wife looked dejected, and the most careful toilet could not conceal the change in her melancholy countenance. It grieved me to see her; ah, that they were but as happy and tranquil as I! I am almost forty years of age. As solitary as I lay in my cradle, thus solitary stand I yet on the edge of the grave. I have gone through life like a shadow, and my Kfe has been like a shade. More and more it vanishes from my eyes; but the Eternal Father, whose will I have obeyed, opened to me a new, a glorious life, to which I advance"

Revenge upon Christians was the motive principle of the riot; but the prospect of plunder stimulated numbers, and here Christians could not minister to their desires. They began the day by the attack upon the provision-shop, and now they had reached the aristocratic quarter of the city, and they gazed with envy and cupidity at the noble mansions which occupied it. They began to shout out, ""Bread, bread!"" while they uttered threats against the Christians-; they violently beat at the closed gates, and looked about for means of scaling the high walls which defended them in front. The cravings of famished men soon take form and organization; they began to ask relief from house to house. Nothing came amiss; and loaves, figs, grapes, wine, found their way into the hands and mouths of those who were the least exhausted and the least enfeebled. A second line of fierce supplicants succeeded to the first; and it was plain that, unless some diversion were effected, the respectable quarter of Sicca had found a worse enemy than the locust. The houses of the government susceptor, or tax collector, of the tabularius or registrar, of the defensor or city counsel, and one or two others, had already been the scene of collisions between the domestic slaves and the multitude, when a demand was made upon  196 Callista; the household of another of the Curia, who held the office of Flamen Dialis. He was a wealthy, easygoing man, generally popular, with no appetite for persecution at all, but still no desire to be persecuted. He had more than tolerated the Christians, and had at this time a Christian among his slaves. This was a Greek, a splendid cook and perfumer, and he would not have lost him for a large sum of money. However, life and limb were nearer to him even than his dinner, and a Jonah must be cast overboard to save the ship. In trepidation, yet with greater satisfaction, his fellow-domestics thrust the poor helpless man out of the house, and secured the door behind him. He was a man of middle age, of a grave aspect, and he looked silently aud calmly upon the infuriated and yelling multitude, who were swarming up the hill about him, and swelling the number of his persecutors. What had been his prospects, had he remained in his earthly master's service P his fill of meat and drink while he was strong and skilful, the stocks or scourge if he ever failed to please him, and the old age and death of the worn-out hack who once has caracoled in the procession, or snorted at the coming fight.

Lybeaus Disconus (Ritson, Met. Rom. ii. 55) fought with a giant ‘that levede yn Termagaunt.' The Old French form is Tervagant, Ital. Tervagante or Trivigante, as in Ariosto. Wheeler, in his Noted Names of Fiction, gives the following account—‘Ugo Foscolo says: “Trivigante, whom the predecessors of Ariosto always couple with Apollino, is really Diana Trivia, the sister of the classical Apollo.” . . . According to Panizzi, Trivagante or Tervagante is the Moon, or Diana, or Hecate, wandering under three names. Termagant was an imaginary being, supposed by the crusaders, who confounded Mahometans with pagans, to be a Mahometan deity. This imaginary personage was introduced into early English plays and moralities, and was represented as of a most violent character, so that a ranting actor might always appear to advantage in it. See Hamlet, iii. 2. 15."" Fairfax, in his translation of Tasso (c. i. st. 84) speaks of Termagaunt and Mahound, but Tasso mentions “Macometto' only. See also Spenser, F. Q. vi. 7.47.

The phantom, he said, had driven him on to the spot where his enemies lay in wait for him; and when he was flying from them, and looked back to see if they were near, the only figure he discerned was that of the maiden running with her long hair fallen about her, as when in life she ran before him, and pointing a drawn sword at him.

But now for thee and me this time of preternatural awakening is wellnigh over. The life in each is but a weak spark of that which glowed in Eberhard and his vassal. In each of us doubtless it lingers for some reasonable purpose, whether one day to be re-united to its ampler source, or to take new shapes, and work for other than human ends in some different region of existence. Of this much be thou sure, that life is more and worthier than its outward agitations and clamours, the sea larger and more stable than its bubbles. There are millions of connected, concentric realities, ever revolving and unfolding themselves, which must each do its own work steadily, not dashing and exploding into the track of its neighbour. All these may, by the nobler intelligences, be studied and understood, if love, and faith, and patience be not wanting. But it is the prerogative of folly to fancy that revolt, display, noise, subjugation can be profitable for anything, and that, when these are impossible, existence stagnates.

Partly for this reason, and partly because of the overwhelmingly tragical catastrofe of its close, the story will probably be less popular than most of the author's previous ones; yet it contains some of his very best work, whether in the portrayal of character, the artistic adjustment of incident, or the poetical description of scenery, ... In many cases the disenchantment follows so close-upon the charm that no great harm is done; but when the comedy is played with an intense, passionate, fine-strung mature like Macleod's, the result is likely to be tragic, whether, as would commonly be the case, the victim summons resolution to brave his fate and silently endure the inevitable, or whether, as in the more soul-piercing catastrofe of Macleod of Dare, his dethroned and distempered reason prepares for both betrayer and victim an oblivion-luring drift of ‘Death's black wine’.” [Appleton's. 807 MADAME DELPHINE, [by G.; W. CABLE: Scribner, 1881.] “The characters move in the quaint, half oriental NewOrleans of other days. There is a group of singularly interesting persons,—an ideal pirate sanctified by a great and sudden love; a beautiful quadroom, sad with all the tragedy of her class; a wise, liberal, noble-hearted priest, and a few admirably sketched minor characters.” [Amer. 808 MADAME THERESE.. [by ERckMANN and CHATRIAN: Scribner, 1869.] “The story is told in the simplest manner by one who was a boy at the time of the scenes described, and lived in a little village in the midst of the Vogesen with his uncle, a filanthropic old doctor, a filosofer, and a lover of peace, but ready to be awakened by that great volcanic movement which began to upheave all Europe in 1792. Without any apparent purpose of making the novel historical, the authors, in their descriptions of the village discussions over the ominous rising of the french people, and of the military movements and spirited engagements which sweep ruthlessly over the quiet village, give a glance into the strange, unsettled life of the time, which brings it before us with wonderful reality and distinctness. Madame Therese is a vivandière of rare elevation of character, who is left for dead in the streets of the village, after a fierce conflict in which her soldier comrades are engaged with the austrian troops, and rescued by the good Dr. from the inhumanity of the villagers and from the vengeance of the Austrians.” [Galaxy. 809 MADEMOISELLE [by F.

Returning to the huts they found the young hunter whom they had accompanied on the preceding day, and beckoned to him to accompany them. When they reached the spot from which the ostriches were visible they motioned to him to come out and shoot them. He at once nodded. As they were about to follow him back to camp for their bows and arrows, he shook his head and signed to them to stay where they were, and going off by himself returned with his bow and arrow, and, to the surprise of the boys, the skin of an ostrich. To show the lads what he intended to do he put on the skin, sticking one arm up the long neck, his black legs alone showing. He now imitated the motions of the bird, now stalking along, now picking up bits of grass, and this with such an admirable imitation of nature that Ned and Tctm shoutod with laughter. The three then set off together, taking a line which hid them from the view of the ostriches. The Indian at last led them to a small eminence and signed to them to ascend this, and there to lie down and watch the result.

In another moment his bow twanged and the ostrich next to him fell over, pierced through with an arrow; while the rest of the flock scattered over the plain at an immeuse speed. Ned and Tom now rose to their feet and ran down the slope to the Indian, who was standing by the dead bird. He pulled out the tail feathers and handed them to them, cut off the head and legs, opened and cleaned the body, and then putting it on his shoulder started again for the camp. For another week they remained in the Indian village, and in that time picked up a good many native words. They then determined that they must be starting on their westward journey.

The Harleian MS. alone reads Fleet Street, which is certainly wrong. Considering that Thames Street is especially mentioned as a street for vintners (Liber Albus, p. 614', and that Chaucer's own father was a Thames Street vintner, there can be little doubt about this matter. The poet is here speaking from his own knowledge; a consideration which gives the present passage a peculiar interest. Chepe is Cheapside. 1. 565. This is a fine touch. The poet here tells us that some of this strong Spanish wine used to find its way mysteriously into other wines ; not.

Observe the humour in the word growing, which expresses that the mixture of wines must be due to the proximity of the vines producing them in the vineyards, not to any accidental proximity of the casks containing them in the vintners' cellars. In fact, the different kinds of wine were to be kept in different cellars, as the Regulations in the Liber Albus (pp. 615-618) shew. Item, that no Taverner shall put Rhenish wine and White wine in a cellar together.' ""Item, that new wines shall not be put in cellars with old wines. “Item, that White wine of Gascoigne, of la Rochele, of Spain, or other place, shall not be put in cellars with Rhenish wines. •Item, that white wine shall not be sold for Rhenish wine.'

After a while he met a man with a goose, and he swopped away the sheep for the goose; and when he had walked a long, long time, he met a man with a cock, and he swopped with him, for he thought in this wise, ""Tis surely better to have a cock than a goose."" Then he went on till the day was far spent, and he began to get very hungry, so he sold the cock for a shilling, and bought food with the  174 KOnSE TALES. money, for, thought Gudbrand on the Hill-side, ""'Tis always better to save one's life than to have a cock.""

The boy, who had been struck by the circumstance, and who, besides, was grateful to Walsingham for some little instances of kindness, spoke with much enthusiasm in his favour, and, as M. de Villars afterwards repeated, finished his speech by exclaiming, “I would give every thing I have in the world, except my sword and my honour, to procure this English captain his liberty? “ M. de Villars was pleased with the boy's manner, and with the fact which he related; so much so, that he promised, that if Walsingham's liberty could be obtained, he would procure it. And you, my good little friend, shall, if I succeed,' added he, ' have the pleasure of being the first to tell him the good news.' “Some days afterwards, the boy burst into Walsingham's room, exclaiming, • Liberty ! liberty! you are at liberty !'he danced and capered with such wild joy, that it was some time before Wal MANEUVRING. 195 singham could obtain any explanation, or could prevail on him to let him look at a letter which he held in his hand, flourishing it about in triumph.

No favour could be granted in a manner more honourable to all the parties concerned. Walsingham arrived in England withoạt any further difficulties.” "" Thank God!"" said Mr. Palmer. “ Well, now he has touched English ground again, I have some hopes for him. What next?” “ The first thing he did, of course, was to announce his return to the Admiralty. A court martial was held at Portsmouth, and fortunately for him, was composed of officers of the highest distinction, so that the first men in his profession became thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances of his conduct. The enK 2  196 MANEUVRING. thusiasm with which his men bore testi mony in his favour, was gratifying to his feelings, and the minutes of the evidence were most honourable to him. The court pronounced, that Lieutenant Walsingham had done all that could be effected by the most gallant and judicious officer in the defence of his Majesty's ship Resolute. The ministry who had employed Captain Campbell were no longer in place, and one of the Lords of the Admiralty at this time happened to have had some personal quarrel with him. A few days after the trial, Walsingham was at a public dinner, at which Campbell's character became the subject of conversation."

He rejoiced, too, in the cognomen of Beelzebub. The name was not personal, but patronymic, belonging to him and his. He was a character withal, and had his joke and his saying for all times and all people; could cant or swear, pray or drink, be saint or sinner, Brianite or churchman, as the time served. Beyond our bounds, though within reach of the noise and hubbub of our sports, stood, a little removed from the road, a square brick-house, surrounded by a high wall, hiding all save the upper windows. The opening of the gate, too, was closed with latticed-work surmounted by a row of spikes, so that everything which met the eye of passers-by was cold, hard, and formal. A stray bough of laurel escaping over the wall, or a spray of ivy peeping above the line of enclosure, alone gave signs of the verdure which was said to luxuriate within. Here  THE LIGHT ON THE HEARTH. 11 lived Roger Trevenna, gentleman. The habitation was suited to the man. Tall, dark, and sombre, his exterior was forbidding enough ; yet the figure, though spare and sinewy, was straight and wellknit; and the face would have been handsome, savo for the expression of gloom and coldness which lay upon it, and which seemed to have been inlaid by constant pressure, not stamped in by sudden grief, or pain, or conscience. The expression had not tho coldness of marble, but the dark, harder fixedness of bronze. The features were of the Norman type, large, and finely cut, the brow lofty and smooth ; but it was the smoothness of dark waters which the sun cannot lighten and the wind cannot stir. The hair was straight, and of the jet-black hue which defies time, care, or climate, to touch it with grey. He had left his native place in early youth -had come back a more than middle-aged man. A brother had gone with him-he returned alone. Of his intermediate life little was known. It was generally supposed that he had been a planter in the West Indies, had known vicissitudes, and endured deep trouble. None of his kith or kin were left to welcome him home. The house where he was born, and where his forefathers had lived for generations, was empty; he bought it, and there abode with his wife, a gentle lady, meek and reserved, unknown to, and unknowing, those amid whom she was thus placed ; gracious and charit 12 TALES FROM “BLACKWOOD."". able, yet joyless, she reflected, in"

However, it's a road we must travel once; and where die better than fighting for one's country? For my part, I would sooner die on a ship's deck, with the thunder of the cannon sounding in my ears, than on a bed of the finest down.” The people on the shore, seeing that the danger way over, and that the British had gained the victory, had now manned several boats, and were approaching the ships. In the foremost of these was old Ben, who, being the proprietor of the village in which he lived, took upon himself, on all expeditions by sea, the office of commodore of the fleet. “A noble fellow the captain of that there little craft,"" exclaimed Ben, as he approached the Hawk; ""he deserves to be made an admiral, whoever he is. Gracious Heaven, there is my own nephew, Harry!” cried he, springing up the fore chains. “ My own uncle, Ben !” exclaimed Harry, springing forward to embrace him. Cordial, indeed, was the meeting of the uncle and nephew; and perhaps it were difficult to tell  THE SEA FIGHT. 283 which was the greater—the joy of the nephew, or the pride of the uncle. “But you are all blood, Harry,” said the uncle—""you must be wounded.” “A mere scratch,” said Harry; “but some of my poor fellows have suffered; but, as the wind favours, we had better get the vessels into the harbour.” The news of the engagement had spread like wildfire through the country; and, as the vessels approached the harbour, crowds of people were waiting to cheer the gallant fellows who had fought so nobly. The wounded were immediately conveyed on shore and distributed among the inhabitants, who were eagerly striving which should receive them; whilst those who had fallen, both French and English, were decently interred, side by side, in that parrow house where all feuds and animosities are buried in oblivion. The rest of our story is soon told. Harry, soon after the engagement, was united to Maria, with the consent of all parties. For some time after his marriage, he still went to sea; but, on the decease of Maria's father, his property devolving upon him, he retired to enjoy the society of his amiable wife, and that domestic repose to which his toils and labours so well entitled him. Clark, the first lieutenant, having fallen in battle, on Harry's giving up the service, Archer was promoted to the command of the Hawk, and he soon after married Susan, Harry's sister.

The ditcher conducted him across the green, and past the end of a house, which was described as being the schoolhouse, and was newly built, and led him towards a humble building, the height of which was but a single storey, and which was found occupied by a millwright as a workshop. Yet, again, the stranger rejoiced to find that the occupier venerated his premises for the poet's sake, and that he honoured the genius of him who was born in their precincts. “Dash it!""* said the stranger, quoting the habitual phrase of poor Leyden, “I shall fish none to-day."" And I wonder not at his having so said; for it is not every day that we stand beneath the thatch-clad roof or any other roof--where was born one whose name time will bear written in undying characters on its wings, until those wings droop in the darkness of eternity. The stranger proceeded up the Teviot, oftentimes thinking of Leyden, of all that he had written, and occasionally repeating passages aloud. He almost forgot that he had a rod in his hand-his eyes did anything but follow the fly, and, I need hardly say, his success was not great. About mid-day, he sat down on the green bank in soli. tariness, to enjoy a sandwich, and he also placed by his side a small flask, containing spirits, which almost every angler, who can afford it, carries with him. But he had not sat long, when a venerable-looking old man saluted him with""Here's a bonny day, sir.” The old man stood as he spoke. There was something prepossessing in his appearance ; he had a weatherbeaten face, with thin white hair ; blue eyes, that had lost somewhat of their former lustre, his shoulders were rather bent; and he seemed a man who was certainly neither rich nor * This was a common expression of Leyden's, and, perhaps, was in some degree expressive of bis headlong and determined character.

The old man appeared exactly one of those characters whom you will occasionally find fraught with the traditions of the Borders, and still tainted with, and half believing in, their ancient superstitions. I wish not to infer that superstition was carried to a greater height of absurdity on the Borders than in other parts of England and Scotland, nor even that the inhabitants of the North were as remarkable in early days for their superstitions,"

Somehow or other, however, Mary Clement failed to see the matter from her mistress's point of view, though she appeared to be ready to listen to her disinterested advice, and even began to make ready for her departure. Indeed, it is said by one fussy chronicler of minute details that she ""went upstairs and began to pack up her boxes,"" as apprentices and servant-girls usually do in snch cases. Be this, however, as it may, one thing is certain, namely, that the next morning, when Mr. Rennie opened his shop, there was no Mary Clement to be seen or found; and that as the day wore on she never returned to her needle. It appears that immediately on leaving Mrs. Rennie's presence she had rushed upstairs to the apartments of the ""handsome Englishman; when""—to use the words of the biographer of the Walpoles— ""he received her with open arms; she vowed  .THE THREE MISS WALPOLES. 151 that she would never leave him; and she kept her word."" It is to be hoped, however, that Mr. Walpole, when he thus ""received her with open arms,"" really meant only to wait for her father's death in order to give the poor girl who had thus thrown herself wholly on his honour, that position of a wife to which her beauty, her affection for him, and her then unsullied good name, conspired to entitle her. By Mary Clement he had five children, two sons and three daughters; and it is due to his memory to add that he took every care which the fondest of fathers could take of their education. As children they were all remarkably handsome, like their parents. Her first boy appears to have died in childhood, having been probably carried off by the measles or the small-pox, which at that time claimed its annual tribute of victims from every house of ""the upper ten thousand;"" but of the three girls, as they grew up to womanhood, a contemporary writer of gossip avows his firm belief that, if the three Graces of the heathen poets returned to earth, it was doubtful whether they would be more afraid of the fair Walpoles or of the fair Gunnings (whom I have already mentioned) as rivals.

Not being able to advance far into “ the bower,” she looked round in an interesting manner, and said, “she could  182 not remember it, and she was quite sure she could not when she sat down."" Hereupon Mrs. Sidney, and Mrs. Bartley, and Mr. William, recounted various ballads which she had been heard by all the parties at different times to warble forth. To each there was some objection; and nothing could be found even in the four great books which she could be prevailed upon to have any thing to do with. Well, d--n it, then, sing 'God save the King,' if you can't sing any thing else,” exclaimed Captain Sidney, who was sitting near, and not slightly provoked with the folly of his daughter. “ God save the King! la, papa, that is so very old.” “ I think Rule Britannia would have rather the advantage in novelty,” said Mr. Henley. "" I don't think I ever learn't Rule Britannia ;' and, if I did, I am sure I could not recollect it.""  183 “Heaven forbid you should!"" thought Eliza. Mr. Waldegrave was upon the point of stepping forward to say to Miss Sidney,“ Suppose you appoint Miss Rivers your deputy upon this occasion,” when Mrs Bartley closed the debate by saying, “Well, Maria, we must excuse you for to-night; and Julia, Harriet, William, come! sing the Canadian Boat song! after which, Sir George, I believe it will be time for us to be taking our leave. Mr. Bartley, I will trouble you to order the carriage.” After some consultation about taking their parts, the Canadian Boat song was at length begun, and concluded, which it might as well have been without any consultation at all; as, long before the end of the business, the three parts were all mingled in one. The young ladies, with much unanimity, began after this fashion ; but Mr. William, for some time, most manfully endeavoured to  184 make himself master of his own proper notes, and when they escaped him, chased them with enterprising valour through every division of the gamut.

From the moment when, on the stormy night, the tones of the wife, whom he knows to be far distant, float weirdly to Wieland up the wooded slope, our attention is held and bewildered. The soft voice which thrills in on Clara through the thunderous twilight,—which breathed at her pillow at midnight,—which shrieked at her very ear as she was making her way up the dark staircase, touches us with the same horror that enveloped the haunted girl. The face revealed to her in the flash of the lamp as she turns wildly, ""every muscle tense, forehead and brow drawn into vehement expression, lips stretched as in the act of shrieking, eyes emitting sparks,"" out-terrorizes a whole phalanx of ghosts. An indescribably weird effect is imparted to the scene by the words, ""The sound and the vision were present and departed at the same instant, but the cry was blown into my very ears while the face was many paces distant!"" Edgar Huntly, with its somnambulism, is not equally successful. The first appearance of the sleep-walker is somewhat impressive. But this auspicious opening is a promise unfulfilled. Clithero's history and remorse are too absurd, and after that the whole book resolves itself into a tale of Indian adventure, which, indeed, in its prophecy of Cooper, is the most interesting part of the story. Arthur Mervyn, a story of the Yellow Fever Plague of 1798 in New York, gives ample scope for the growing interest in physical horrors which, as we have seen, is a characteristic of the School of Terror. Though Brown certainly dwells far too much on this physical horror for its own sake, he is yet eminently skilful, also, in using it justifiably for the artistic enhancement of higher sensations. One striking instance of his power in such combination is that in which the apparition appears to Arthur as he stands alone in the desolate chambers of a fever-smitten house from which all the inhabitants have been removed for burial.

O  194 A FELLOW-PASSENGER water. in > The first time that I met Mr. Algernon Read was on board a large steamer homeward bound. I was sitting with my two little sisters on deck, watching the cool awnings flapping in the soft warm wind. The sea was violet and green, with far-away flakes of foam ; there was neither land nor yet a sail to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, save the measured creaking of the ship as she cleft her way through the rounded hollows and over the curled ridges of the iridescent My youngest sister, a child of ten, who had only lately recovered from low fever, complained of feeling tired and faint, and asked me to carry her down to her cabin. I took her up my arms' and tried to make my way to the stairs,' as we ignorantly called the companion’; but the ship was rolling, and I found it difficult to keep from falling. Presently a gentleman came up to me with a courteous bow, and before I could gainsay him he had taken Felicia gently out of my arms and had carried her to her cabin. But my heart smote me for letting him do it. He was about two-and-twenty, very small, with a delicate refined face, and a bright hectic flush on each cheek. His hands were like those of a girl, and had that transparent look, like egg-shell china, which is so common in consumption. His hair was almost white, it was of so pale a flaxen ; the eyes were large and dreamy, and had dark lines round them ; but there was something very frank and simple in the facesomething fresh and innocent, like a child. He did not give  A FELLOW-PASSENGER 195 me time to thank him, but when, a few hours later, I chanced to see him on deck, I went up to him and expressed my gratitude He smiled.

What is the good of being a man, and stronger than most people, if one makes no use of one's strength.' This assumption of strength startled me so much that I was silent. • There are some porpoises to be seen,' he said, after a pause, if you care to come to the side of the ship.' We went and watched the strange black things leaping gaily through the water, and we gradually fell into conversation. I learnt that Mr. Algernon lived with his mother in the suburbs of London, that he was her sole surviving son, and that he was at present returning to her from a long sea voyage which he had undertaken for his health. Not that there is much the matter with me,' he said, coughing all the while, 'but I fancy I went in too much for athletics at

""Would it not have been wiser, Eccellenza, before you had taken one wife to have made sure you had lost the other?"" Despite his nerve and habitual impassiveness, Sabretasche started: a deadly anguish of dread fastened upon him. ""Tours is a very stale device,"" he said calmly.

He stood leaning his arm upon the top of his easel; his tall and graceful figure erect; pride, scorn, loathing written on his features, and in the depths of his eyes; speaking gently and slowly,—but very bitterly !—in his low and silvery voice. The tone, the glance, woke all the malice that slept in the Italian's heart for his sister's high-born and high-souled husband. His eyes glittered like an angry animal's; he dropped the smoother tone which he had used before, for one of coarse and malicious vindictiveness.

In the year preceding his death, he granted a charter, dated at this fortress, confirming a convention between the monks of Melrose, and those of Holmcultram. ""This old castle of Lochmaben,"" it is said by Chalmers in his Caledonia, "" continued the chief residence of this respectable family, during the 12th and 13th centuries. Robert de Brus, the first Earl of Carrick, of this dynasty, probably repaired the Castle at Annan.""

As he had only a few men with him, the deserted state of the place made it comparatively an easy acquisition. He thus addressed himself to the gallant Sir John Grahame, and his other companions:— ""I wald sailye,a giffb ye think it may be, Lowmaban houss, quhilk now is left allayne; For weill I wait0 power in it is lewytcl nane.e Carlauerok als yeitf Maxwell has in hand; And we had this, thai mycht be baiths a wand Agayne11 Sotheroun,* that now has our cuntre.

Oh, for a painter's brush to give you the.queenly figure and pose of her as she thus stoodI Her arms sank to her side, and she said quietly, 'Have no fear for me, Mr. Musgrave.

The Good Hope was, at that moment, trembling on the summit of a swell. She subsided, with sickening velocity, upon the farther side. A wave, like a great black bulwark, hove immediately in front of her; and, with a staggering blow, she plunged head-foremost through that liquid hill. The green water passed right over her from stem to stern, as high as a man's knees; the sprays ran higher than the mast; and she rose again upon the other side, with an appalling, tremulous indecision, like a beast that has been deadly wounded. Six or seven of the malcontents had been carried bodily overboard; and as for the remainder, when  182 THE BLACK ARHOW. they found their tongues again, it was to bellow to the saints and wail upon Lawless to come back and take the tiller.

These leaves are smeared with a species of bird lime, made by bruising the berries of an indigenous tree by no means scarce; they are then strewed, with the gluten uppermost, near to the opaque spot to which it is understood the tiger usually resorts during the noon-tide heats. If the animal should chance to tread on one of these smeared leaves his fate may be considered as decided. He commences by shaking his paw with a view to remove the adhesive encumbrance, but finding no relief from that expedient, he rubs the nuisance against his face with the same intention, by which means his eyes, ears and face become agglutinated. The consequent uneasiness causes him to roll, perhaps, among many more of the smeared leaves, till at length he becomes completely enveloped and is deprived of sight: in this state he may be compared to a man who has been tarred and feathered. The anxiety produced by this strange and novel predicament soon discovers itself in dreadful howlings, which serve to call the watchful peasants, who now find no difficulty in dispatching their formidable enemy.  138 parley's tales Another mode of destroying tigers, common towards the north of Hindustan, consists of a large semi-spherical cage made of strong bamboos or other efficient materials, wove together, but leaving intervals throughout about four or five inches broad. Under this cover, which is fastened to the ground by means of pickets in some place where tigers abound, a man, provided with two or three short strong spears, takes post at night, being accompanied by a dog, which gives the alarm; or by a goat, which, by its agitation answers the same purpose; the adventurer wraps himself up in his quilt and very composedly goes to sleep, in full confidence of his safety. When a tiger comes, and perhaps after smelling all round begins to rear against the cage, the man stabs him with one of the spears through the interstices of the wicker-work, and rarely fails in destroying the beast. The tiger himself is reported sometimes to use no small degree of artifice for securing his prey. Dr. Fryer mentioned a curious stratagem employed by them for catching monkeys. ""The woodmen,"" says he, assert, "" that when the tiger intends to prey upon the monkeys he has recourse to this expedient:  ABOUT INDIA. 139 the monkeys, at his first approach, give warning by their confused chatterings, and immediately take themselves to the smallest and highest twigs of the trees, when the tiger, seeing them out of his reach and sensible of their fright, lies couchant under the tree and then begins to roar, at which they tremblingly let go their hold, and, tumbling down, he picks them up to satisfy his hunger.""

It was natural that one with such highwrought feelings as our heroine should love one to whom she could look up, and on whom to depend, rather than her childhood's playmate—the gay, thoughtless Henry. Louis's family had been the victim of a moral ruin, as hers of a physical one. They had been oppressed, reduced to poverty, driven from their homes by a feudal tyrant, and had come poor and forlorn from a distant district. His mother, accustomed to a bourgeois' life, died broken-hearted: his father, a man of violent passions, nourished in his own and in his son's heart, sentiments of hatred and revenge against the ""proud oppressors of the land."" They were obliged to labour hard, yet in the intervals of work, father and son would read or discourse concerning the ills attendant on humanity, and they traced all to the social system, which made the few the tyrants of the many. Louis was handsome, bold, and active; he excelled his compeers in every hardy exercise; his resolution, his daring, made him, in spite of his poverty, a kind of leader among 'them. He had many faults; he was too full of passion, of the spirit of resistance and revenge; but his heart was kind; his understanding, when not thwarted, strong; and the very depth of his feelings made him keenly susceptible to love. Fanny, in her simple but majestic beauty, in her soft kindness of manner, mingled with the profoundest sensibility, made a deep impression on the young man's heart. His  THE SWISS PEASANT. 193 converse, so different and so superior to those of his fellows, won her attention. Hitherto Fanny had never given utterance to the secrets of her soul. Habitual respect held her silent with Madame, and Henry, as spirited and as heedless as a chamois, could ill understand her; but Louis became the depositary of the many feelings which, piled up in secrecy and silence, were half awful to herself; he brought reason, or what he deemed such, to direct her heart-born conclusions. To have heard them talk of life and death, and all its shows, you would have wondered by what freak philosophy had dressed herself in youth and a peasant's garb, and wandered from the schools to these untaught wilds. Madame de Marville saw and encouraged this attachment. Louis was not exactly the person she would have selected for Fanny; but he was the only being for whom she had ever evinced a predilection; and, besides, the danger of a misalliance which threatened her own son, rendered her eager to build an insurmountable wall between him and the object of his affections. Thus Fanny enjoyed the heart-gladdening pride of hearing her choice applauded and praised by the person she most respected and loved in the world.

As she crossed the portal, a sensation of terror, ill-defined, but painful and overwhelming, smote upon her heart—such as we feel in the presence of a secret enemy; and Lord Greville's increasing uneasiness and abstraction since he had returned to the mansion of his forefathers, did not tend to enliven its gloomy precincts. The wind beat wildly against the casement of the apartment in which they sat; and which, although named “the lady’s chamber,” afforded none of those feminine luxuries, which are now to be found in the most remote parts of England, within the dwellings of the noble and wealthy. By the side of a huge hearth, where the crackling and blazing logs imparted the only cheerful sound or sight in the apartment, in a richly-carved oaken chair, emblazoned with the armorial bearings of his house, sat Lord Greville, lost in silent contemplation. A chased goblet of wine, with which he occasionally moistened his lips, stood on a table beside him, on  THE MAID OF HONOUR. 207 which an elegantly fretted silver lamp was burning; and while it only emitted sufficient light to render the gloom of the spacious chamber still more apparent, it threw a strong glare upon his expressive countenance and noble figure, and rendered conspicuous that richness of attire which the fashion of those stately days demanded from “the magnates of the land;” and which we now only admire amid the mummeries of theatrical pageant, or on the glowing canvass of Vandyck.

The output of Minneapolis for the crop year of 1898-99 was 15,164,881 barrels, and for Duluth-Superior for the same period 2,637,035 barrels. The estimate for the whole state is 25,000,000 barrels. These figures are taken from the Northwestern Miller, a reliable publication in Minneapolis. The credit of having introduced the Hungarian and French processes into Minnesota is due primarily to the late Gov. C. C. Washburn of La Crosse, Wis., who was greatly aided by his partner at the time, Mr. George H. Christian of Minneapolis. While I am convinced that the credit of first having  196 History of Minnesota. introduced these valuable inventions into Minnesota belongs to Gov. C. C. Washburn and his partner Mr. George H. Christian, I am in justice bound to add that Gov. John S. Pillsbury and the late Mr. Charles A. Pillsbury, who were large and enterprising millers at Minneapolis, owning the Excelsior Mills, immediately after its introduction adopted the process, and put it into their mills, and by employing American skilled artizans and millers to set up and operate their machinery, succeeded in securing the first absolutely perfect automatic mill of the new kind in the country. General Washburn, having imported Hungarian millers to start and operate his experimental mills, found himself somewhat handicapped by their inefficiency and sluggishness in adopting American ways and customs. THE DISCOVERT OF IRON. From the earliest days of the territory the people had predicted the growth of cities at several points. At St. Paul, because it was the head of navigation of the Mississippi river; at St. Anthony, on account of its great water power; at Superior, as being the head of navigation of the Great Lakes system; and at Mankato, from its location at the great bend of the Minnesota river. It must be remembered that when these prophesies were made Minneapolis and Duluth had no existence, and Superior was the natural outlet of the St. Louis river into Lake Superior, and had its land titles not been so complicated when the railroad from St. Paul to the head of the lakes was projected, there is no doubt Superior would have been the tyminus of the road; but it was found to be almost impossible to procure title to any land in Superior, on account of its having been sold by the proprietors in undivided interests to parties all over  History of Minnesota. 197 the country, and it was situated in Wisconsin, so the railroad people procured the charter of the company to make its northern terminus on the Minnesota side of the harbor, where Duluth now stands, and founded that town as the terminus of the road.

It seemed a long time before they could see any signs of the native, who had to make a long detour so as to approach the birds up wind.

""Why?"" Tom asked; ""I am bathed in perspiration now."" ""We shall not want it for heat, but the chances are that there are wild beasts of all sorts in this forest."" Ned's premises turned out correct, for scarcely had night fallen when they heard deep roarings, and lost no time in ascending a tree, and making themselves fast there, before they went to sleep. In the morning they proceeded upon their journey. After walking a couple of hours Ned laid his arm upon Tom's shoulder. ""Hush I"" he whispered; ""look there."" Through the trees, at a short distance off, could be seen a stag. He was standing gazing intently at a tree, and did not appear to have heard their approach. ""What can he be up to?"" Tom whispered. ""He must have heard us."" ""He seems paralysed,"" Ned said. ""Don't you see how he is trembling? There must be some wild beast in the tree."" Both gazed attentively at the tree, but could see nothing to account for the attitude of the deer. ""Wild beast or no,"" Ned said, ""he will do for our dinner."" So saying, he unslung his bow, and fitted an arrow; there was a sharp twang, and the deer rolled over, struck to the heart. There was no movement in the tree, but Ned placed another arrow in place; Tom had done the same.

""Have your sword ready in case of need. I cannot help thinking there is something there, though what it is I can't make out."" Slowly, and with the greatest caution, they approached the tree. All was perfectly still. ""No beast big enough to hurt us can be up there,"" Ned said at last; ""none of the branches are thick enough to hide him. Now for the stag."" Ned bent over the carcass of the deer, which lay a few feet only from the tree. Then suddenly there was a rapid movement among the creepers which embraced the trunk, something swept between Ned and Tom, knocking the latter to the ground, while a cry of alarm and astonishment rose from Ned. Confused and surprised Tom sprang to his feet, instinctively drawing his sword as he did so. For a moment he stood paralysed with horror. A gigantic snake had wound its coils round Ned's body. Its head towered above his, while its eyes flashed menacingly, and its tongue vibrated with a hissing sound as it gazed at Tom; its tail was wound round the trunk of the tree. Ned was powerless, for his arms were pinioned to his side by the coils of the reptile. It was but a moment that Tom stood appalled. He knew that at any instant by the tightening of its"

Three hours later they suddenly emerged from a part where the hills approached nearer on either side than they had done during the day's walk, and a mighty landscape opened before and below them. The boys gave simultaneously a loud shout of joy, and then dropped on their knees in thanks to God, for far away in the distance was a dark level blue line, and they knew the ocean was before them. ""How far off should you say it was, Ned?"" Tom asked when they had recovered a little from their first outburst of joy. ""A long way off,"" Ned said; ""I suppose we must be fifteen thousand feet above it, and even in this transparent air it looks an immense distance away. I should say it must be a hundred miles."" ""That's nothing!"" Tom said; ""we could do it in two days, in three easily."" ""Yes, supposing we had no interruption and a straight road,"" Ned said. ""But we must not count our chickens yet. This vast forest which we see, contains tribes of natives bitterly hostile to the white man, maddened by the cruelties of the Spaniards, who enslave them and treat them worse than dogs. Even when we reach the sea we may be a hundred or two hundred miles from a large Spanish town, and however great the distance, we must accomplish it, as it is only at large towns that Captain Drake is likely to touch.""

These, glad again to turn their faces homeward, set off at once, and the lads, shouldering their packs, started up the valley. The scenery was grand in the extreme, and Ned and Tom greatly enjoyed it. Sometimes the sides approached in perpendicular precipices, leaving barely room for the little stream to find its way between their feet, at others it was half a mile wide. When the rocks were not precipitous the sides were clothed with a luxuriant foliage, among which the birds maintained a concert of call anil song. So sheltered were they that, high as it was above the sea, the heat was very oppressive, and when they reaohed the head of the valley late in the afternoon they were glad indeed of a bath in a pool of the stream. ^Choosing a spot of ground near the stream, the lads mow made a fire, put their pieces of venison down to roast, and prepared for a quiet evening.

It is six months now since we left the western coast, and one almost seems to forget, that one is English.

The difficulty will be to persuade the people on the other side that we are whites."" ""How far do you think the sea lies on the other side of this range of giant mountains?"" Tom asked. ""I have no idea,"" Ned replied, ""and I do not suppose that any one else has. The Spaniards keep all matters connected with this coast a mystery; but I believe that the sea cannot be many days' march beyond the mountains."" For an hour or two they chatted quietly, their thoughts naturally turning again to England and the scenes of their boyhood. ""Will it be necessary to watch, think you?"" Tom asked. ""I think it would be safer, Tom; one never knows. I believe that we are now beyond the range of the natives of the Pampas. They evidently have a fear of approaching the hills; but that only shows that the natives from the other side come down over here. I believe that they were, when the Spaniards landed, peaceable people, quiet and gentle. So at least they are described. But those who take to the mountains must be either escaped slaves, or fugitives from the cruelty of the Spaniards, and even the gentlest man, when driven to desperation, becomes savage and cruel.

They gathered a quantity of the bread-fruit and passed the guava bush reluctantly. ""We must set to work to make a basket, captain,"" Stephen said, ""we want such a thing badly. We can each make a good-sized bag out of sacking, which will do very well for melons and bread-fruit, but we want something that we can carry things like guavas in without crushing them."" On their return to the camp they found, as Stephen expected, that Jacopo was absent, and at once set out along the edge of the cliff until they reached the point at which they obtained a view into the bay. The wreck lay apparently deserted. ""Let us sit down and watch,"" Stephen said, ""he may not ( M 220) o  210 WITH COCHRANE THE DAUNTLESS. have reached it yet. No, there he is."" As he spoke, a figure came out from the door of the poop. ""Just as I thought, captain. He has gone down to see if the gold is there. Look at him."" Jacopo was evidently furious; they could see him waving his arms and stamping angrily on the deck, and then he went to the side and shook his fist in the direction of the tent. ""That fellow is dangerous, captain,"" Stephen said gravely. The captain nodded. ""The safest plan will be to shoot him at once."" ""No, we cannot do that; we had better tell him frankly tonight that we have moved the gold and buried it, lest the vessel should go to pieces in a storm, that we intend to give it up to any Spanish or Chilian ship that may come here; but that if it is a long time before we are rescued we shall then divide the gold between us, and that he will get a fair share of it."" ""It would be better to shoot him,"" the captain said. ""You were right, it is evident that he has been thinking over that money, and that as likely as not he has determined to possess the whole of it. However, we shall see"

The five men were all engaged now; the spears whizzed fast over and among them, but most of them were thrown almost at random, for the blacks soon learned that to raise themselves above the bushes to take aim was to court sudden death. Jim, after distributing the saddles to their owners, had lain down by the side of his master and loaded his rifle as fast as he discharged it, Reuben using his pistols as effectually as the rifle in the intervals. Fortunately all the party were provided with these weapons; had it not been so each man would have been liable to be rushed by the blacks every time he discharged his rifle. As far as possible they fired by turns, so that each man while loading was covered by the fire of those on his right and left. For half an hour the fight continued. Many of the blacks had fallen, but they continued the assault as vigorously as before, and all the defenders had received more or less serious wounds from the spears. ""The others ought to have been here long before this,"" Reuben said, ""if they had followed my instructions. I only hope they have not been attacked too; but as we don't hear any firing that can hardly be so.""

Reuben exclaimed, ""I can hear the trampling of horse's hoofs. The moment they arrive make a rush for your horses and charge."" ""I am afraid the horses are killed,"" Dick said ruefully. ""In that case,"" Reuben said, ""we must get to our feet and pick off the blacks as they run; they will get up like a covey of partridge as the horsemen come among them."" A loud cheer was heard, and the little party, with an answering shout, sprang to their feet and, rifle to shoulder, stood expecting the blacks to rise; but the ears of the natives were sharper than those of the whites, and they had begun to crawl away before the latter heard the approaching horsemen. Finding this to be the case the party ran to their horses; four exclamations of wrath and grief were heard, for seven of the horses were completely riddled with spears.

[Now they speak it, and talk it, and tell it.] Nicolette having thus made her little hut, and thatched it thickly on the inside and on the outside with fresh leaves and fragrant flowers, hid herself under a bush to see what Aucassin would do. Now the rumor ran through all the country that Nicolette was lost. Some said that she had escaped, and others said that the Count Garin had killed her. If everybody else had been sure of this, Aucassin would not have been. But of this he gave no sign. And his father, well pleased to be rid of Nicolette, ordered that he should be released from prison, and bade all the knights and damsels of the country give fêtes for him, which might distract him. The day when Nicolette disappeared, when the court of the count was crowded with knights and ladies, Aucassin was leaning against a pillar, all de NICOLETTE AND AUCASSIN. 129 jected, and out of his senses with sorrow, and only thinking of her he loved. A knight who saw how melancholy he was came to him and said, — “Aucassin, I have been sick of the same disease as you, so that I know how to give you good advice, if you will only hear me."" “Thank you, sir !” said Aucassin ; “for indeed I am greatly in need of good advice and cure.” Then the knight said, “ Mount your horse, and go into the woods yonder. The sight of the plains, the sweet odor of the plants, and the songs of the little birds will all comfort you, believe me.” ""Thank you, indeed, sir !” said Aucassin. “I will gladly do so."" So he went out from the hall at once, and went down the steps, hurried to the stable, and put saddle and bridle on one of his horses, which was waiting there. He put his foot in the stirrup, sprang upon the noble beast, and rode out from the castle walls. Once outside, he remembered the advice which the knight had given to him, and went straight to the woods. Here he soon met the shepherds seated on the grass around the spring, eating their bread with great joy ; for it was now noon.

Human intelligence is too finite to penetrate or compre• hend a system so complex, and yet so uniform. The mind of man can only form a just idea of a cause when the effect has been made manifest to his understanding. There might have been a reason for the death of Mary Wolston — who knows? But if it were so, that reason was beyond the pale of mortal ken. ' Let us not, however, anticipate. Mary Wolston is not yet dead. On the contrary, when the ninth day of her illness had passed, Fritz and Jack were returning from an expedition, the nature of which was only known to themselves, but which, to judge from the packs that they bore on their backs, had been tolerably productive. The two young men observed their mother advancing, as usual, to meet them, but this time she ran. They had no need to be told in words that Mary Wolston was now out of danger; the serenity of their mother's countenance was more eloquent than the most elaborate discourse that ever stirred human souls. Mrs. Becker herself felt that words were superfluous, so she quietly took her son's arm, and they walked gently homewards, whilst Jack strode on before. On turning a corner of the road, the latter stumbled upon Wolston and Ernest, who, in the exuberance of their joy, had also come out to meet the hunters. They were, however, a little behind; but that was nothing new. These two members of the colony had become quite remarkable for procras. tination and absence of mind. When Wolston the mechanician, and Ernest the philosopher, travelled in company, it was rare that some pebble or plant, or question in physics, did not induce them to deviate from their route or tarry on their way. One day they both started  WILLIS THE PILOT. 179 for Rockhouse to fetch provisions for the family dinner, but instead of bringing back the needful supplies of beef and mutton, they returned in great glee with the solution of an intricate problem in geometry. All fared very indifferently on that occasion, and, in consequence, Wolscon and Ernest were, from that time on, deprived of the office of purveyors. In the present instance, instead of running like Mrs. Becker, they had philosophically seated themselves on the trunk of a tree. At their feet was a diagram that Wolston had traced with the end of his stick ; this was neither a tangent nor a triangle, as might have been expected, but a figure denoting how to carve one's way to a position, amidst the rugged defiles of life. « In all things,"" observed Wolston, “in morals as well as physics, the shortest road from one point to another, is the straight line."" “Unless,"" objected Ernest, “ the straight line weré encumbered with obstacles, that would require more time to surmount than to go round.

Latent memories were aroused as keenly as if the events had but just occurred, and he sank at his Mother's feet.

It has been a secret, and then it has been forgotten; but now I remember all, and understand far more than I once did."" Here Joachim recounted to his Mother the whole story of her words to him, and his adventures with the Genie and the bottle; and then, very slowly, and interrupted by many tears of repentance, he repeated what the Genie had said about giving him the power of imitation, adding that the use he made of it must depend on himself and the great Ruler of the heart and conscience. There was a great fuss among the Cousins at the notion of Joachim having talked to a Genie; and, to tell you the truth, this was all they thought about, and soon after took their leave. The heart of Joachim's Mother was at rest, however: for though she knew how hard her son would find it to alter what had become a habit of life, she knew that he was a good and pious boy, and she saw that he was fully alive to his error. “Oh Mother,” said he, during the course of that evening,“ how plain I see it all now!

W. point of Fernandina or Exuma, whence Columbus took his departure, to the group of Mucaras, which lie east of Cayo Lobo on the grand bank of Bahama, and which correspond to the description of Columbus. If it were necessary to account for the difference of three leagues in a reckoning, where so much is given on conjecture, it would readily occur to a seaman, that an allowance of two leagues for drift, during a long night of blowy weather, is but a small one. The course from Exuma to the Mucaras is about S. W. by W. The course followed by Columbus differs a little from this, but as it was his intention on setting sail from Isabella to steer W. S. W., and since he afterwards altered it to west, we may conclude that he did so in consequence of  Eppendix. 247 having been run out of his course to the southward, while lying to the night previous. Oct. 27.-At sunrise Columbus set sail from the Isles Arenas or Mucaras, for an island called Cuba, steering S. S. W. At dark, having made seventeen leagues on that course, he saw the land and hove his ships to until morning. On the 28th he made sail again at S. S. W., and entered a beautiful river with a fine harbor, which he named San Salvador. The journal in this part does not describe the localities with the minuteness with which everything has hitherto been noted ; the text also is in several places obscure. This port of San Salvador we take to be the one now known as Caravelas Grandes, situated eight leagues west of Nuevitas del Principe. Its bearings and distance from the Mucaras coincide exactly with those run by Columbus ; and its description agrees, as far as can be ascertained by charts, with the port which he visited. Oct. 29.-Leaving this port Columbus stood to the west, and having sailed six leagues he came to a point of the island running N. W., which we take to be the Punta Gorda; and, ten leagues farther another stretching easterly, which will be Punta Curiana. One league farther he discovered a small river, and beyond this: another very large one, to which he gave the name of Rio de Mares. This river emptied into a fine basin resembling a lake and having a bold entrance. It  248 Appendir. had for landmarks two round mountains at the S. W. and to the W. N. W. a bold promontory suitable for a fortification, which projected far into the sea. This we take to be the fine harbor and river situated west of Point Curiana; its distance corresponds with that run by Columbus from Caravelas Grandes, which we have supposed identical with Port San Salvador. Leaving Rio de Mares the 30th of October, Columbus stood to the N. W. for fifteen leagues when he

One was for visiting the East and exploring the interior of Asia. He had, as has been before observed, a vague notion that valuable discoveries were to be made there, and many useful inventions in the arts brought back to the stock of European knowledge. “Thus, in Siberian Tartary,"" observed he, in one of his writings, ""the natives extract a strong spirit from milk, which is a secret probably unknown to the chemists of Europe. In 169  170 Oliver Goldsmitb the most savage parts of India they are possessed of the secret of dyeing vegetable substances scarlet, and that of refining lead into a metal which, for hardness and color, is little inferior to silver.” Goldsmith adds a description of the kind of person suited to such an enterprise, in which he evidently had himself in view : “He should be a man of philosophical turn, one apt to deduce consequences of general utility from particular occurrences; neither swoln with pride, nor hardened by prejudice; neither wedded to one particular system, nor instructed only in one particular science ; neither wholly a botanist, nor quite an antiquarian ; his mind should be tinctured with miscellaneous knowledge, and his manners humanized by an intercourse with men. He should be in some measure an enthusiast to the design ; fond of travelling, from a rapid imagination and an innate love of change; furnished with a body capable of sustaining every fatigue, and a heart not easily terrified at danger."" In 1761, when Lord Bute became prime minister on the accession of George the Third, Goldsmith drew up a memorial on the subject, suggesting the advantages to be derived from a mission to those countries solely for useful 1  Literary Jobs 171 and scientific purposes ; and, the better to insure success, he preceded his application to the government by an ingenious essay to the same effect in the Public Ledger, His memorial and his essay were fruitless, his project most probably being deemed the dream of a visionary. Still it continued to haunt his mind, and he would often talk of making an expedition to Aleppo some time or other, when his means were greater, to inquire into the arts peculiar to the East, and to bring home such as might be valuable. Johnson, who knew how little poor Goldsmith was fitted by scientific lore for this favorite scheme of his fancy, scoffed at the project when it was mentioned to him. “Of all men,"" said he, “Goldsmith is the most unfit to go out upon such an inquiry, for he is utterly ignorant of such arts as we already possess, and, consequently, could not know what would be accessions to our present stock of mechanical knowledge. Sir, he would bring home a grinding-barrow, which you see in every street in London,"

You see, sir,” he went on, “if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it's hard to say where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can dodge back along the shore.” “The current's less a'ready, sir,” said the man Gray, who was sitting in the fore-sheets; “you can ease her Off a bit.” “Thank you, my man,” said I, quite as if nothing had happened; for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves. Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a little changed. “The gun!” said he. “I have thought of that,” said I, for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort. “They could never get the gun ashore, and if they did, they could never haul it through the woods.” “Look astern, doctor,” replied the captain. 128  THE JOLLY-BOAT'S LAST TRIP We had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were the five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. Not only that, but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones aboard. “Israel was Flint's gunner,” said Gray, hoarsely. At any risk, we put the boat's head direct for the landing-place. By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could keep her steady for the goal. But the worst of it was, that with the course I now held, we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the Hispaniola, and offered a target like a barn door. I could hear, as well as see, that brandy-faced rascal, Israel Hands, plumping down a round-shot on the deck. “Who's the best shot?” asked the captain. “Mr. Trelawney, out and away,” said I. “Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir? Hands, if possible,” said the captain. Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun. “Now,” cried the captain, “easy with that gun, sir, or you'll swamp the boat.

For these opini0ns he may almost be said to have suffered. Baptized and brought up in the Church of Scotland, he had, upon some conscientious scruple, joined the communion of the Baptists. Like other Nonconformists, these were inclined to the liberal side in politics, and, at least in the beginning, regarded Buonaparte as a deliverer. From the time of his joining the Spearmen, Thomas Smith became in consequence a bugbear to his brethren in the faith. ""They that take the sword shall perish with the sword,"" they told him; they gave him ""no rest""; ""his position became intolerable""; it was plain he must choose between his political and his religious tenets; and in the last years of his life, about 1812, he returned to the Church of his fathers. August 1786 was the date of his chief advancement, when, having designed a system of oil lights to take the place of the primitive coal fires before in use, he was dubbed engineer to the newly-formed Board of Northern Lighthouses. Not only were his fortunes bettered by the appointment, but he was introduced to a new and wider field for the exercise of his abilities, and a new way of life highly agreeable to his active constitution. He seems to have rejoiced in the long journeys, and to have combined them with the practice of field sports. ""A tall, stout man coming ashore with his gun over his arm ""—so he was described to my father — the only description that has come down to me — by a lightkeeper old in the service. Nor did this change come alone. On the 9th July of the same year, Tho210  DOMESTIC ANNALS mas Smith had been left for the second time a widower. As he was still but thirty-three years old, prospering in his affairs, newly advanced in the world, and encumbered at the time with a family of children, five in number, it was natural that he should entertain the notion of another wife. Expeditious in business, he was no less so in his choice; and it was not later than June 1787 — for my grandfather is described as still in his fifteenth year—that he married the widow of Alan Stevenson. The perilous experiment of bringing together two families for once succeeded. Mr. Smith's two eldest daughters, Jean and Janet, fervent in piety, unwearied in kind deeds, were well qualified both to appreciate and to attract the stepmother; and her son, on the other hand, seems to have found immediate favour in the eyes of Mr. Smith. It is, perhaps, easy to exaggerate the ready-made resemblances; the tired woman must have done much to fashion girls who were under ten; the man, lusty and opinionated, must have stamped a strong impression on the boy of fifteen."

It has been long entirely deserted, and the vestiges only can be discerned with difficulty; for the loose sand, borne on the tempestuous gales of those stormy regions, has overblown, and almost buried, the ruins of the buildings; but in the end of the seventeenth century a part of the Earl's mansion was still entire and habitable. It was a rude building of rough stone, with nothing about it to gratify the eye, or to excite the imagination; a large old-fashioned narrow house, with a very steep roof, covered with flags composed of gray sandstone, would perhaps convey the best idea of the place to a modern reader. The windows were few, very small in size, and distributed up and down the building with utter contempt of regularity. Against the main structure had rested, in former times, certain smaller compartments of the mansion-house, containing offices, or subordinate apartments, necessary for the Earl's retainers and menials. But these had become ruinous; and the rafters had been taken down for firewood, or for other purposes; the walls had given way in many places; and, to complete the devastation, the sand had already drifted amongst the ruins, and filled up what had been once the chambers they contained, to the depth of two or three feet. Amid this desolation, the inhabitants of Yarlshop had contrived, by constant labor and attention, to keep in order a few roods of land, which had been enclosed as a garden, and which, sheltered by the walls of the house itself from the relentless sea-blast, produced such vegetables as the climate could bring forth, or rather as the sea-gale would permit to grow; for these island experience even less of the rigor of cold than is encountered on the mainland of"

I pass over the stories of his juvenile loves — of Hannah Lightfbot, the Quaker, to whom they say he was actually married (though I don't know who has ever seen the register) — of lovely black-haired Sarah Lennox, about whose beauty Walpole has written in raptures, and who used to lie in wait for the young Prince, and make hay at him on the lawn of Holland House. He sighed and he longed, but he rode away from her. Her picture still hangs in Holland House, a magnificent masterpiece of Reynolds, a canvas worthy of Titian. She looks from the castle window, holding a bird in her hand, at black-eyed young Charles Fox, her nephew. The royal bird flew away from lovely Sarah.

Briggs was the house-dog whom Rebecca had provided as guardian of her innocence and reputation. Miss Crawley had left her a little annuity. She would have been content to remain in the Crawley family with Lady Jane, who was good to her and to everybody; but Lady Southdown dismissed poor Briggs as quickly as decency permitted; and Mr. Pitt (who thought himself much injured by the uncalled-for generosity of his deceased relative towards a lady who had only been Miss Crawley's faithful retainer a score of years) made no objection to that exercise of the dowager's authority. Bowls and Firkin likewise received their legacies, and their dismissals; and married and set up a lodging-house, according to the custom of their kind.

They fired upon ea other as much as upon the enemy, and soon fled to the woods. The Senecas followed them until they were checked by the French Indians. The number of killed on either side is not certainly known; but the French chief commander, De Nonville, was so much dispirited by his loss, that he could not be persuaded to continue his march that day. The Senecas, therefore, had time to burn their village and retire. Two of their children only courageously remained to receive De Nonville, and to be tortured for the amusement of his Indian allies. After destroying the corn in this and several other villages, the French army retired to the banks of the lake, and erected a fort on the south-east side of the straits of Niagara. Here they left one hundred men, under the command of one De la Troye, with eight months' provisions. They were soon after closely besieged by their Indian enemies, and all perished but seven or eight. In August of the year 1637, Colonel Dongan, the New York governor, met the sachemsofthe Five Nations at Albany, and confirmed the English alliance with them by presents and speeches. In the spring of the next year, a party of Onondaga Indians (one of these five tribes) surprised a few French soldiers near Fort Frontenac. Instead of murdering them, how  88 HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE STATES. ever, they confined them to hard labor (as a return for the fate of those thirteen Indians whom the French had sent to labor in old France). Lamberville, a French riest, used his utmost skill to regain them; but finding his efforts fruitless, he gave the Onondagas two wampum-belts, to secure their kindness to the prisoners, and prevent their joining the Senecas in Open War. A treaty was formally made, this season, between the French and the Five Nations; but it was soon interrupted by a singular event. The Dinondadie Indians, who lived on the river St. Lawrence, had lately begun to trade with the English, and their friendship was, therefore, suspected by the French. Adario, their chief sachem, now undertook to regain the confidence of the latter nation, by performing some notable exploit against their old enemies, the Five Nations. He

James Billings habitually slept but little, and that little at whatever time proved most convenient. He rarely dismissed any of the many problems which, at different periods, thronged his busy brain, before he had worked out a satisfactory solution. It was his habit, always before seeking repose, to think over any conversation of interest in which he had been engaged, and to calculate how far he had succeeded in making the impression he desired.  At such times his thoughts almost invariably took the form of words, and he appeared to derive increased self-satisfaction from the sound of his own voice.  On the present occasion he drew off his boots, incased his feet in a pair of morocco slippers, lighted a fragrant Havana, and settled himself comfortably down to thinka aloud. "" For a man of sense,"" so ran his thoughts, ""for a man of sense, and very few troublesome scruples, Hamilton was startled more than could have been expected when I hinted at the indispensable necessity of putting George Washington out of the way when our plans were ripe, or nearly so.

Helen was touched by this speech, especially as she entirely believed her sister, for Emma was not one who made sentimental speeches. A short time after this visit, Mrs. Temple took her two daughters with her, to dine at Lady S's. As they happened to go rather earlier than usual, they found nobody in the drawing-room but the French governess, Mademoiselle Panache. Helen, it seems, had conceived a very sublime idea of a French governess, and when she first came into the room she looked up to Mademoiselle Panache with a mixture of awe and admiration. Mademoiselle was not much troubled with any of that awkward reserve which seems in England sometimes to keep strangers at bay for the first quarter of an hour of their acquaintance. She could not, it is true, speak English very fluently, but this only increased her desire to speak it; and between two languages she found means, with some difficulty, to express herself. The conversation, after the usual preliminary nothings had been gone over, turned upon France and French literature. Mrs.' Temple said she was going to purchase some French books for her daughters, and very politely begged to know what authors Mademoiselle would particularly recommend. "" FVat auteurs?"" —you do me much honour madame —"" Vat auteurs? why, JAIesdenwiselles, there's Telemaque and Belisaire."" Helen and Emma had read Telemaque and Belisaire, so Mademoiselle was obliged to think again. ""./ttendez!"" cried she, putting up her fore-finger in an attitude of recollection.

A faithful service in Freemasonry, ever since 1817, has enabled him to gather up rare treasures of Masonic light, applicable to the ninety-nine cases that usually come up before Masonic lodges.  But this is the hundredth. The other thirty Brethren, present to-night, sit in various stages of distress. Some exhibit a sort of skepticism upon their faces, as though in doubt of the ability of their W. M. to adjudicate this question. One is making a pencil memorandum of the affairs to send to Brother; one mentally determines that he will pump            on the theme;  a third resolves ""to bring it up before the Grand Lodge next G. A. C.,""-but no device nor work is found among the thirty which goes to unravel this skein so knotty. The question is this: The landlord of the Ollock's House, Brother Braham Willis, a good fellow and a true, has reported that there is stopping with him a Dutch gentleman-all foreigners with him are Dutch, but not all gentlemen; no, ""not by a long chalk ""-a Dutch gentleman who called there a few days back to spend the Sabbath, was taken sick during Sabbath hours; while at church, and ""now lies flat with the typhoid fever.  No one knows him; his baggage only contains some clothing and a few Dutch manuscripts, which nobody in Papyrus can read; and, worst of all, he has n't a picayune about him.""  (This latter expression denotes, if our memory serves us right, that the poor gentleman is entirely 177   BROTHER BAUER FROM BERLIN. divested of all metallic substances; a horrid condition, as we are personally aware, to be in!   The landlord, therefore, reports the case to the lodge, and asks some help to pay his board bills, together with a pretty salty account of nurses, a saltier one of doctors, with the probable saltiest one of undertakers. Brother Braham Willis is a poor man himself, and while he does all he can to relieve human distress, he acknowledges to-night that he is not able to do much. But we are mistaken; this is not the perplexity of the case.  It is a small matter to move ""that the Committee of Charity ""-composed, of course, of the Master and Wardens-"" have plenary power in the case to appropriate the lodge funds."" Seconded-adopted unanimously. It is a small thing for Benevolence Lodge to agree to give even as much as fifty dollars at a time, when necessary to serve God in that way. The real difficulty is this. It is this: Among the manuscripts of the unfortunate foreigner, already alluded to, is one engrossed upon parchment, which, to a man up in the third degree, looks amazingly like a Masonic diploma. It is sealed heavily, the wax bearing no faint impression of Masonic symbols. It is signed by three and four, in the usual manner of such documents,"

I think she was on the point of doing so then, but the dark   storm came dashing down, and the thundercloud broke right   above the house, as it seemed. Her mother, roused from sleep,   called out for Phillis ; the men and women from the hayfield came   running into shelter, drenched through. The minister followed,   smiling, and not unpleasantly excited by the war of elements ;   for, by dint of hard work through the long summer's day, the   greater part of the hay was safely housed in the barn in the field.   Once or twice in the succeeding bustle I came across Phillis,     238 COUSIN PHILLIS.     always busy, and, as it seemed to me, always doing the right   thing. When I was alone in my own room at night I allowed   myself to feel relieved : and to believe that the worst was over,   and was not so very bad after all. But the succeeding days were   very miserable. Sometimes I thought it must be my fancy that   falsely represented Phillis to me as strangely changed, for surely,   if this idea of mine was well-founded, her parents — her father   and mother — her own flesh and blood — would have been the first   to perceive it. Yet they went on in their household peace and   content ; if anything, a little more cheerfully than usual, for the   ""harvest of the first fruits,"" as the minister called it, had been   more bounteous than usual, and there was plenty all around, in   which the humblest labourer was made to share. After the one   thunderstorm, came one or two lovely serene summer days, during   which the hay was all carried ; and then succeeded long soft rains   fining the ears of corn, and causing the mown grass to spring   afresh. The minister allowed himself a few more hours of relaxation and home enjoyment than usual during this wet spell : hard   earth-bound frost was his winter holiday ; these wet days, after   the hay harvest, his summer holiday. We sate with open windows, the fragrance and the freshness called out by the soft-falling^   rain filling the house-place ; while the quiet ceaseless patter   among the leaves outside ought to have had the same lulling   effect as all other gentle perpetual sounds, such as mill-wheels   and bubbling springs, have on the nerves of happy people.

Poetry was prohibited, and Miss Seward resorted to other amusements, and to the practice of ornamental needlework, in which she is said to have excelled. Thus rolled on time for nearly ten years after her father had settled in Lichfield. When it is considered that her attachment to literary pursuits bor MISS SEWARD. 203 dered even upon the romantic, the merit of sacrificing them readily to the inclination of her parents, deserves our praise. But other incidents occurred in her own life, and that of a confidential friend, that called for stronger exertions of prudence, selfdenial, and submission to parental authority. There are, in Miss Seward's letters during this period, passages which show great firmness and steadiness of mind, and a capacity of compelling feelings, which nature, and perhaps early cultivation, had strung to a keen tone, to submit to the dictates of prudence and of duty. I regret that many of the lessons which she taught her own heart, and that of her friend, must be withheld from the public, lest, even at this distance of time, the incidents to which they relate might injure the feelings of any concerned in them. In 1764, a heavy calamity took place in Mr Seward's family. Miss Sarah Seward, his younger daughter, had been for some time on the eve of forming a matrimonial connexion with Mr Porter, a merchant at Leghorn, brother to Mrs Lucy Porter of Lichfield, and son-in-law, of course, to the celebrated Dr Johnson. Miss Anna Seward was to have accompanied her sister to Italy, and already anticipated, with delight, the pleasure of treading classical ground, of viewing the paintings of Raphael, and wandering among the groves of Valambrosa. These flattering prospects were clouded by the sickness and death of the young and lovely bride. An affecting account of this distressing calamity occurs among the following  5204 BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES, &C. extracts from Miss Seward's Correspondence.i Mr Porter appears afterwards to have intimated a wish to transfer his attachment to the surviving sister; but it was not encouraged. When time had softened the recollection of this domestic loss, Miss Seward made her sister's death the subject of an elegy, which forms the first article in this collection of her poetry. The blank in her domestic society was supplied by the attachment of Miss Honora Sneyd, then residing in her family, and often mentioned in the ensuing volumes. This young lady was afterwards married to the late ingenious Mr Edgeworth of Edgeworthstown, Ireland, father of the celebrated Maria Edgeworth. After the death of Miss Sarah Seward, her sister Anna's society became indispensable to her parents, and she was never separated from them. Offers of matrimonial establishments occurred, and were rejected, in one instance entirely, and in others chiefly, from a sense of filial duty. As she was now of an age to select her own society and studies, Miss Seward's

It is said that when at Mount Vernon, it was his habit to rise before the dawn of day in the dark mornings of winter. He struck a light in his tinder-box and kindled his own fire when the morning was cold, and lighted also the tallow candles, made under Mrs. Washington's superintendence. Contrary to the custom of the wealthy planters of Virginia, he dressed and shaved himself, except that a servant combed his hair and tied his queue.  166 A ZIGZAG JOURNEY IN THE SUNNY SOUTH. His shaving apparatus has been preserved to this day by the descendants of his step-son, Mr. Custis. As soon as he was dressed, he usually wrote some of his business correspondence, made entries in his diary, and wrote out directions for his overseers. Desk-work he disliked, but he performed it with care and exactness. This irksome labor done, he went to the stable near the mansion house, and enjoyed a long inspection of his horses, of which he was extremely fond. He  BITTITUR QUES TI TATLAN EMUDIAN DOWS STUTTGARTNIM TERUS SEE TE M ERORIN D 10 WASHINGTON'S HOUSE AT MOUNT VERNON. usually had about twenty carriage and saddle horses in the home stable, beside fifty or sixty draught-horses on the farms which composed his estate. A love of the horse was hereditary in the Washington family. His own mother, it is said, was as good a judge of a horse as any man in Virginia. Upon returning from the stable, Washington sat down to an old-fashioned Virginia breakfast, which consisted chiefly of the four h's, - hominy, ham, hoe-cake, and honey, — with a cup or two of tea or coffee.

His estate consisted of three thousand two hundred and sixty acres, divided into five farms, each having its own overseer, its own barns, stables, and negro quarter. His slaves usually numbered between four hundred and fifty  168 A ZIGZAG.

Under Mrs. Washington's own eye all their clothes were cut and made; and if sickness broke out in one of the quarters, it was the General himself who commonly visited and prescribed for them, often giving them their medicine with his own hands. Sometimes, in periods of epidemic, he would spend many hours of the night in their huts. All

One of the guard fired upon him, and he was mortally wounded. No inquiry was made, or at least no punishment inflicted on him who had committed the outrage. ""All the revengeful feelings, natural to savages, were called up on the occasion. The Natchez flew to arms, and the French were assailed on every side, and many of them fell. The Stung Serpent, an influential chief, interposed his authority, and the slaughter ceased. A new treaty of peace was the result of the discussion that ensued, and the whole affair seemed to be buried in oblivion. ""Soon after this, in the year 1723, under different pretexts, several hundred soldiers were secretly introduced into the settlement, and the defenceless and unsuspecting Natchez were slaughtered in their huts. The head of the first chief was demanded as the price of peace, and the wretched Natchez were obliged to yield to the demand. The slaughter had continued four days, before peace was granted them. This was a deed, of course, never to be forgotten nor forgiven by the savages. They saw at once, that there now remained no alternative 8  86 HISTORY OF THE WESTERN STATES. between their own destruction or that of their enemies. They were moody, pensive, timid and slow; but they were sure in devising the means of vengeance. ""Things remained in this situation until 1729. At this time, M. de Chopart, who had been the chief agent in these transactions, and who was excessively obnoxious to the savages, had been ordered to New Orleans, to meet an investigation of his conduct touching this affair. The joy of the savages was great; for they hoped, at least, to be delivered from his enmity and oppression. To their despair, they learned that he was justified, and reinstated in his authority. He seemed, on his return, more vindictive towards them than ever. To manifest his ill feelings, he determined to build a town, two miles below the present site of Natchez, on ground occupied by a large and ancient village of the Indians. Accordingly, he sent for the Sun chief, and ordered him to have the savage huts cleared away, and the inhabitants dispersed. The chief replied, ' that their ancestors had dwelt there for ages; and that it was good that their descendants should dwell there after them.'

When they had departed, she kissed . · Jessie, saying that the letter had agitated her a great deal, and, therefore, she would retire to her room, for the rest of the evening.  50 ARTHUR MONTEITH. William, during his walk to Lochmore, informed Allen that business, which he could not mention, even to him, required his immediate presence in London. “I must see Sir Charles directly; and, therefore, I mean to leave this place in a few hours; but Lady Beaumont must not know where I am gone at present. I could have wished, Allen, to have taken you along with me; but I know not how I can do that without exci. ting her ladyship's suspicion, and alarming her as to the nature of my business."" Allen stopped hastily, and, catching hold of his father's arm, said, “I too, dear father, should wish, of all things, to go to London. Nay, I even doubt whether your business is of more consequence than mine ; but till you mentioned your desire of taking me with you, I had not dared even to admit the possibility of accomplishing it. Secrecy, however, is so essential with regard to my motives for going to London, that I am not at liberty to explain them, even to you. But if you write a note to Lady Beaumont, saying, that you have determined on carrying me with you to Edinburgh, she may naturally suppose, you intend to inquire about the next winter's classes at the University for me. This notion will satisfy her mind, for at least a week or ten days; and I hope, by that time, I shall be able, either to write to her myself, and explain the reason of my absence, or else to leave London on my return home.” ""I don't quite understand, Allen, what motive you can have for wishing so earnestly to go to London ; unless, indeed, it is to see your dear bro ARTHUR MONTEITH. 81 ther, and that is not necessary to be kept a secret; but, as you do not ask me to explain my plans, I will not press for yours.

It is the reward, both of children and parents, who have lived together as we have done, that in times of even seeming mystery, they can fully, and unconditionally, trust to each other, without harbouring a doubt on either side. I will write the note you have suggested, and you shall accompany me on my journey. May we both succeed in the business in which we are so much interested !” ""I thank you,"

Though I thus obtained my object, I soon found I had relinquished a considerable  CONRAD BLESSINGTON. 123 portion of my father's interest -- that the sway I had so long maintained was gone for ever. The fact was, he had contemplated my adding lustre to the already well-known and respectable cognomen of Blessington, by following his steps, but finding so great a disappointment, he turned to my brother for the fulfilment of his hopes. This circumstance, however, gave me but little annoyance ; I was young and thoughtless, a favourite in my regiment, well supplied with cash at all times, and possessed of every wish and incitement to enjoy my numerous advantages; I drank deep of the cup of pleasure during the next few years, running deeper and deeper into every excess. My father removed my pecuniary difficulties more than once, admonishing me each time to be more prudent. Vain remonstrance! I had not made a promise of amendment many weeks, no, nor days, when I saw, and in seeing, loved your hapless mother. My regiment was stationed in the immediate neighbourhood of her father's house, and I soon contrived to procure an introduction to the family, in which was centred the being I adored. A reciprocity of feeling was soon obvious, and for a short time we enjoyed the most delightful in 124 CONRAD BLESSINGTON. tercourse. Mr. Ward, however, saw and disapproved our growing attachment, though we were quite unconscious of his doing so; he learnt my character was not such as he could approve, and he discouraged my visits; still I persevered, until, alarmed for his child's happiness, he forbid me the house. It was then I became aware how deeply I was wounded by the shafts of the boy god. Unaccustomed from infancy to control my passions, I loved with a blind fury, which was augmented by the obstacles offered to arrest its course. Opposition rendered me more determined to gain my object; private meetings were the consequence, which terminated in my persuading the young and lovely Mary to follow the fortunes of one who swore eternal fidelity. At that time she was not quite eighteen, while I had not attained my twentyfirst year; some excuse may therefore be offered in extenuation of our imprudence. Our plan succeeded to the utmost of our wishes: my regiment was removed to a distant part of the country, and we took advantage of that moment to effect our purpose. We were united by the military chaplain, and I procured lodgings in the town for your mother.

Some of these volunteers acted a little out of character. Lord Mersington, one of the Judges of the Court of Session, lately promoted by James II., at the time when he was distributing his favours equally betwixt Papist and Puritan, attracted some attention from his peculiar appearance: he was girt with a buff-belt about five inches broad, bore a halbert in his hand, and (if a Jacobite eye-witness speaks truth) was “as drunk as ale and brandy could make him.” On the approach of this motley army of besiegers, Wallace, instead of manning the battlements and towers of the palace, drew up his men imprudently in the open court-yard in front of it. He refused to yield up his post, contending, that the warrant of the Privy Council was only signed by a small number of that body. Defiance was exchanged on both sides, and firing commenced ; on which most of the volunteers got into places of safety, leaving Captain Wallace and the major of the city guard to dispute the matter professionally. It chanced that the latter proved the better soldier, and finding a back way into the palace, attacked Wallace in the rear. The defenders were at the same time charged in front by the other assailants, and the palace was taken by storm. The rabble behaved themselves as riotously  164 PLUNDERING OF CATHOLIC CHAPELS. as might have been expected, breaking, burning, and destroying, not only the articles which belonged to the Catholic service, but the whole furniture of the chapel; and, finally, forcing their way into the royal sepulchres, and pulling about the bodies of the deceased Princes and Kings of Scotland. These monuments, to the great scandal of the British government, were not closed until ten or twelve years since, before which time, the exhibition of the wretched relics of mortality which had been dragged to light on this occasion, was a part of the show offered to strangers who visited the palace. This riot, which ascertained the complete superiority of the Presbyterian party, took place on the 10th December, 1688. The houses of various Catholics, who then resided chiefly in the Canongate, were mobbed, or rabbled, as was then the phrase, their persons insulted, and their property destroyed. But the populace contented themselves with burning and destroying whatever they considered as belonging to Papists and Popery, without taking any thing for their own use. This zeal for the Protestant cause was maintained by false rumours, that an army of Irish Catholics had landed in the west, and were burning, spoiling, and slaying. It was even said they

It was a broken cranny on the sea-shore into which the sea beat, and surrounded on every side but the one by huge broken fragments of stone, which at first sight seemed as though they would have admitted of a path down among them to the water's edge; but which, when scanned more closely, were seen to be so large in size, that no man could climb from one to another. It was a singularly romantic spot, but now well known to them all there, for they had visited it over and over again that morning. “In there,” said Danny Lund, keeping well behind Morton's body, and pointing at the same time to a cavern high up among the rocks, but quite on the opposite side of the little inlet of the sea. The mouth of the cavern was not twenty yards from  MARON TROW. 205 where they stood, but at the first sight it seemed as though it must be impossible to reach it. The precipice on the brink of which they all now stood, ran down sheer into the sea, and the fall from the mouth of the caveri on the other side was as steep. But Danny solved the mystery by pointing upwards, and showing them how he had been used to climb to a projecting rock over their heads, and from thenve creep round by certain vantages of the stone till he was able to let himself down into the aperture. But now, at the present moment, he was unwilling to make essay of his prowess is a cragsman. He had, he said, been up on that projecting rock thrice, and there had seen the eyes moving in the cavern. He was quite sure of that fact of the pair of eyes, and declined to asvend the rock again. Traces soon became visible to them by which they knew that some one had passed in and out of the cavern recently. The stone, when examined, bore those marks of friction which passage and repassage over it will always give. At the spot from whence the climber left the platform and commenced his ascent, the side of the stone had been rubbeil by the close friction of a man's body. A light boy like Danny Lund might find his way in and out without leaving such marks behind him, but no heavy man could do so. Thus before long they all were satisfied that Aaron Trow was in the cavern before them. Then there was a long consultation as to what they would do to carry on the hunt, and how they would drive the tiger from his lair. That he should not again come out, except to fall into their hands, was to all of them a matter of course. They would keep watch, and ward there, though it might be for days and nights. But that

The February of the next year saw Jessie at Weymouth, on a visit to a Mrs. Anderson, one of Mrs. Petersfeltt's former friends, and one who had never relinquished her acquaintance, but kept fast hold of her memory; and now sought to render her a valuable service, by shewing Jessie a little more of life in its gayer condition than she could possibly see in the Fair Havens. Her house was the abode of splendour and fashion, and every day the resort of many, even among the élite. It was during that time that George the Third and Queen Charlotte made  126 RAYMOND. this place a favourite residence; their own popular carriage and courteous manner set an example of greater accessibleness on the part of the noblesse, and was taken, it is supposed, as suited their convenience. Grand entertainments were everywhere given, both public and private, among opulent people who were not nobles, at which even royalty itself did not disdain to appear—at least, for a few moments, or half an hour -to give the worthy folks the felicity of handing down, by record or tradition, to coming ages, the veritable fact of their grandsire and granddame's house at Weymouth having once contained their Majesties. To Jessie, these parties as well as the company she commonly saw on the Esplanade, and other modish walks, were gay beyond compare ; not that she, who had lived most part of her life in London, had never seen such a concourse of well-dressed people before; but that the manners of these had an interest to her mind above them. Perhaps she had never been on such an agreeable footing with the men of scarlet broadcloth exterior, and with those, too, of ultra1 1 1  RAYMOND. 127 marine, as she was now and these have a little subtle fascination about them. It was not then so common as at present, to mingle promiscuously grades and professions in society. The long peace has since given honest traders time to weigh their long pockets and full purses,"

CHAPTEE IX. If ever Francis De Burgh felt inclined to despair or murmur at the decrees of Providence, it was during the first few moments after the departure of the gang of miscreants into whose hands he had so easily been led. It appeared to him that every day of his life was marked out for persecution or misfortune, so rapidly did one mishap or another occur. But this despair and doubting of the mercy and goodness of Providence lasted but a brief moment, and sincerely and truly he prayed to be forgiven the momentary feeling that had crept  THE CRUIZE OF THE DARING. 145 over his heart. After a time, he rallied his thoughts, and began to turn over in his mind what might be the result of the cruel outrage inflicted upon him. As to who the instigator of the outrage might be, he was quite satisfied it was Sir Godfrey De Burgh. The visit of the false Captain Burton was merely a species of investigation to learn if possible who his friends were in London. Bill Mullaghan had been no doubt entrapped nearly in the same way. If it was intended to carry him on board a man-of-war, he would in time be able to prove his right to be set at liberty; but he was also aware that those pressed, no matter how illegally, or what their station in life might be, there existed great difficulty in getting their case"

With pure water from the natural rocky fountain, and the provisions brought with them, to which were added fruit from surrounding trees, their breakfast was completed. Julia had wandered up the valley, and returned with the branches of several aromatic trees, which the Doctor informed her were cinnamon and clove. Alice had found the pods of the shrub pepper growing not far distant from their camp, while the Doctor discovered that the land abounded with medicinal plants in abundance and of great efficacy. Alice could not resist gathering bouquets from the beautiful oleanders which grew here and there. Mammoth morning-glories adorned the forest trees, entwining themselves upon their branches, while the tree-moss festooned the drooping limbs of those upon the river's bank.

But when, advancing a little farther, their vision became clearer, the .river would sharply bend to the right or left, affording an unobstructed channel, and dispelling the dreaded obstacle, as the mist disappears before the bright morning sun. At noon they had arrived at a point where small valleys approached the river on either side, widening in its immediate vicinity and narrowing as they slowly rose to higher elevations, far in the background. Alice suggested that they land upon the west bank of the river, where a small stream appeared, watering the valley before referred to, and discharging its clear, sparkling waters into the main river, and that they camp, dine and explore the place before leaving. This idea pleased them all, and Julia, who was at the helm, rounded the "" Petrel"" shoreward. Again all was activity. The Doctor, having selected a pleasant spot beside a large rock, under the shadow of a gigantic forest tree, procured a wide, fiat stone, and, placing it upon the ground beside the other, formed a hearth, and while Julia and Alice gathered dried leaves and sticks, and kindled the fire, he brought the eatables from the boat, and such cooking utensils as they would require in preparing dinner. More fuel being needed, and not finding it at hand, Julia went up the valley some distance in pursuit. Coming to a dry, fallen tree, which gave evidence of having been prostrated by the wind, she was congratulating herself upon this abundant supply, and was about to break off some of the smaller branches and return to Alice, when she noticed her  174 MITYLENE. kid, which had followed her, very busily engaged digging up something, the devouring of which seemed to afford"

She was not prayerful— her spirit did not move to seek the Infinite—her soul was deeply ttill—encompassed, penetrated, filled with the Infinite. In prayer, the soul is active—it moves and seeks something; in meditation, passive; it lies still and receives. So it was with Hester now. The next hour, when Miss Huldah came in, she found her young friend serene and cheerful. ""Have you sent the letter, Miss Huldah ?"" inquired Hester. ""The doctor has, my dear."" Then her baby was brought in and lifted up on the bed. Hester, at the sight of her child, held out her hands and burst into tears. The infant crept up to her mother's pillow, kissed her on the eyes and on the lips, and, taking up the corner of her little apron, tried to wipe the tears from her cheeks.

And beside this weary circle of fruitless toil arose the haunting thought of home—fresh springs of love, ever fresh—life growing, widening, deepening, day by day around us, and all centering in that inner sanctuary of love, the home. I was aroused from my dreams and murmurs by some words from the gospel, which fell on  14 THE DIARY OF my car suddenly, as if I heard them for the first time:— ""For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."" For the first time, the idea of self-sacrifice came to me with all the exalted joy the thought can bring—the thought of laying down myself, my life, for others. I arose from that evening reading strengthened and refreshed, for I had a purpose— and life is never quite barren to us if we have one living purpose to sow in it, to grow and to bring forth fruit. The thought of His life took possession of me. I longed, I prayed, I strove to be made like Him —the holy child Jesus—like Him who went about doing good. I made a collection in the convent, to furnish NanneiTs house—I labored in the convent garden to rear vegetables for the sick—I traveled leagues through the pine forests, in the frost and snow, to visit them—but the more I read of the life of Jesus, the more unattainable the perfect model seemed. Are not the stars as far from the mountains as from the valleys?"

The busy insects were making a ceaseless hum on every side, breaking the still quiet of the clear autumnal evening, and down far beneath him Charles could hear the rush of waters as the river wound its course over its rocky bed. A few leaves were beginning to fall, and in some places the foliage wore tints of a bright autumnal hue, patches of yellow gold here and there, and a warm glow of vivid scarlet.

The old oaks spread out their gnarled roots amongst the green moss, and interlaced their long branches. They had stood in their pride for centuries, bearing the snow flakes of winter on their naked boughs, and rustling their green leaves in the summer breeze, when the bright sun gilded the dark outline of their thick foliage; and so they stood now, with the old abbey, its massive walls, rising clearly visible against the blue sky from the wood that girt it in. The surgeon thought of the noble race who had formerly tenanted its walls, who had often stood, perhaps, where he was standing now, with the same soft murmuring sounds beneath and around them. They had wandered there in the summer sunshine and in the clear, cool days of autumn; the very scent of the wild flowers that at each step he crushed under foot seemed to breathe back memories of the past, of those who had trodden that same ground, and of whom now, little more than some handfulls of dust remained, under the quaint old monument in the village church; and there, too, had laid  dr. harcourt's assistant. 165 for a quarter of a century, with her child resting beside her, the poor, weak, fragile girl of eighteen summers, the last descendant of the St. Aubyn's.

His grandfather resigned to him his seat at Walford as soon as he came of age; and the ambitious and indefatigable old Whig entered into matrimonial negotiations, which ended in the happy marriage of Sampson Burleigh with the Lady Melanie de Clare, the daughter of an eminently liberal peer, whose family had been associated for more than a century with the traditions, triumphs, intrigues, and cabinets of the Whig party. Sir Sampson Gasher died in peace, at his excellent mansion in Portland-place, comforting and staying his parting spirit with the reflection that he had made the best of time and opportunity. He had done all he wished to do.  BLACKRLDGE MANOR. 153 At the period we introduce the reader to the occupants of Harley House, Sampson Burleigh held office. He was highly valued among his party—an effective and earnest speaker, that tall man, with his square, ponderous temples, and serene pale face, always commanded respectful hearers. The infusion of new blood into the old stock of the Burleighs had brought forth good things. Though the ultra-liberals of Walford objected to their member's Whiggery, they contrived to place him at the head of the poll; it gratified them to see their representative come into office with his party, and they were bound to him by strong local ties. Yet Walford was not an easy or comfortable place to canvass or represent. That constituency questioned and worried a candidate who felt all the wisdom and good policy of keeping himself unpledged. Those grim artisans, stained with dye,  154 THE HEIRS OP blacked with fire and smoke, and the dust of iron—men who sweated out their lives in the foetid hot-bed of manufactories, amongst the deafening roar of machinery, or grew into a living disease in working lead and steel—they formed their own rude theories for the amelioration of the lower orders, guided only by the deceitful twilight of nature, and moved by the keen spur of painful necessity. The Lady Melanie was wont to talk democratically, with a charming natural eloquence, and a grace quite foreign to the subject. In her most confidential and epigrammatic table-talk, she declared that several hundreds of her husband's constituents thought themselves quite as competent to conduct the affairs of the nation as any hereditary legislator, or lodger in Downing-street; though she could never exactly find out what post in the cabinet might be the object of the ambition of any  BLACKRIDGE MANOR. 155 one of them—for they seemed generally to wish to regulate the Home Office, the Colonies, the Horse Guards, and the Archbishopric of Canterbury.

""O the cruel, the killing ill-luck that pursues us!"" exclaimed the forlorn Madame Doppeldick, as her husband returned, with his mouth watering, to the little parlor, where, by some sort of attraction, he was drawn into the captain's vacant chair, instead of his own. In a few seconds the plumpest of Adam Kloot's tender souvenirs, of about the size and shape of a penny-bun, was sliding over his tongue. Then another went — and another — and another. They were a little gone or so, and no wonder; for they had travelled up the Rhine and the Moselle, in a dry ""schifT,"" not a ""dampschifF,"" towed by real horse-powers, instead of steam-powers, against the stream. To tell the naked truth, there were only four words in the world that a respectably fresh Cod's head could have said to them, namely, —  ""none of your sauce."" No matter: down they went glibly, glibly. The lemon-juice did something for them, and the vinegar still more, by making them seem sharp instead of flat. Honest Dietrich enjoyed them as mightily as Adam Kloot could have wished; and was in no humor, you may be sure, for spinning prolix answers or long-winded speeches.

""I do not think I can sit up all night,"" she murmured, concluding with such a gape that the tears squeezed out plentifully between her fat little eyelids. ""I've found only one bad one — and that was full of black mud — schloo — oo — oo — ooop!"" slirropped honest Dietrich. N. B. There is no established formula of minims and crotchets on the gamut to represent the swallowing of an oyster: so the aforesaid syllables of ""schloo — oo — oo — ooop"" must stand in their stead.

Here he anchored the next day, south of these islands, which he called Islas de Arena; they were low, and five or six leagues in extent. The distances run by Columbus, added to the departure taken from Fernandina and the distance from these islands of Arena at the time of discovering, give a sum of thirty leagues. This sum of thirty leagues is about three times less than the distance from the S. W. point of Fernandina or Exuma, whence Columbus took his departure, to the group of Mucaras, which lie east of Cayo Lobo on the grand bank of Bahama, and which correspond to the description of Columbus. If it were necessary to account for the difference of three leagues in a reckoning, where so much is given on conjecture, it would readily occur to a seaman, that an allowance of two leagues for drift, during a long night of blowy weather, is but a small one. The course from Exuma to the Mucaras is about S. W. by W. The course followed by Columbus differs a little from this, but as it was his intention on setting sail from Isabella to steer W. S. W., and since he afterwards altered it to west, we may conclude that he did so in consequence of  Appendix. 247 having been run out of his course to the southward, while lying to the night previous. Oct. 27.–At sunrise Columbus set sail from the Isles Arenas or Mucaras, for an island called Cuba, steering S. S. W. At dark, having made seventeen leagues on that course, he saw the land and hove his ships to until morning. On the 28th he made sail again at S. S. W., and entered a beautiful river with a fine harbor, which he named San Salvador. The journal in this part does not describe the localities with the minuteness with which everything has hitherto been noted; the text also is in several places obscure. This port of San Salvador we take to be the one now known as Caravelas Grandes, situated eight leagues west of Nuevitas del Principe. Its bearings and distance from the Mucaras coincide exactly with those run by Columbus; and its description agrees, as far as can be ascertained by charts, with the port which he visited. Oct. 29.-Leaving this port Columbus stood to the west, and having sailed six leagues he came to a point of the island running N. W., which we take to be the Punta Gorda ; and, ten leagues farther another stretching easterly, which will be Punta Curiana. One league farther he discovered a small river, and beyond this another very large one, to which he gave the name of Rio de Mares. This river

Garrick resorted to it for a time, but soon grew shy and suspicious, declaring that most of the authors who frequented Mr. Davies's shop went merely to abuse him. Foote, the Aristophanes of the day, was a frequent visitor ; his broad face beaming with fun and waggery, and his satirical eye ever on the lookout for characters and incidents for his farces. He was struck with the odd habits and appearance of Johnson and Goldsmith, now so often brought together in Davies's shop. He was about to put on the stage a farce called The Orators, intended as a hit at the Robin Hood debating-club, and resolved to show up the two doctors in it for the entertainment of the town. “What is the common price of an oak stick, sir ?” said Johnson to Davies. “Sixpence,"" was the reply. “Why then, sir, give me leave to send your servant to purchase a shilling one. I'll have a double quantity, for I am told Foote means to take me off, as he calls it, and I am determined the fellow shall not do it with impunity.”  168 Oliver Goldsmitb Foote had no disposition to undergo the criticism of the cudgel wielded by such potent hands, so the farce of The Orators appeared without the caricatures of the lexicographer and the essayist.

OTWITHSTANDING his growing success, Goldsmith continued to consider literature a mere makeshift, and his vagrant imagination teemed with schemes and plans of a grand but indefinite nature. One was for visiting the East and exploring the interior of Asia. He had, as has been before observed, a vague notion that valuable discoveries were to be made there, and many useful inventions in the arts brought back to the stock of European knowledge. “Thus, in Siberian Tartary,” observed he, in one of his writings, “the natives extract a strong spirit from milk, which is a secret probably unknown to the chemists of Europe. In 169  170 Oliver Goldsmitb the most savage parts of India they are possessed of the secret of dyeing vegetable substances scarlet, and that of refining lead into a metal which, for hardness and color, is little inferior to silver."" Goldsmith adds a description of the kind of person suited to such an enterprise, in which he evidently had himself in view : “He should be a man of philosophical turn, one apt to deduce consequences of general utility from particular occurrences ; neither swoln with pride, nor hardened by prejudice ; neither wedded to one particular system, nor instructed only in one particular science ; neither wholly a botanist, nor quite an antiquarian ; his mind should be tinctured with miscellaneous knowledge, and his manners humanized by an intercourse with men.

""Only the coyotes!"" was his reflection, on seeing a score of these animals flitting to and fro, skulking along both banks of the stream, and ""squatting"" upon the grass. Hitherto he had felt no fear—only contempt—for these cowardly creatures. But his sentiments underwent a change, on his noticing their looks and attitudes. The former were fierce; the latter earnest and threatening. Clearly did the coyotes mean mischief!  248' THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN. He now lemembered having heard, that these animals—ordinarily innocuous, from sheer cowardice—will attack man when disabled beyond the capability of defending himself. Especially will they do so when stimulated by the smell of blood. His had flowed freely, and from many veins—punctured by the »pines of the cactus. His garments were saturated with it, still but half dry. On the sultry atmosphere it was sending forth its peculiar odour. The coyotes could not help scenting it. Was it this that was stirring them to such excited action— apparently making them mad? Whether or not, he no longer doubted that it was their intention to attack him. , He had no weapon but a bowie knife, which fortunately had kept its place in his belt. His rifle and pistols, attached to the saddle, had been carried off by his horse. He drew the knife; and, resting upon his right knee, prepared to defend himself. He did not perform the action a second too soon. Emboldened by having been so long left to make their menaces unmolested —excited to courage by the smell of blood, stronger as they drew nearer—stimulated by their fierce natural appetites—the wolves had by this time reached the turning point of their determination: which was, to spring forward upon the wounded man. They did so—half a dozen of them simultaneously—fastening their teeth upon his arms, limbs, and body, as they made their impetuous onset. With a vigorous effort he shook them off, striking out with his knife. One or two were gashed by the shining blade, and went howling away. But a fresh band had by this time entered into the fray, others coming up, till the assailants counted a score. The conflict became desperate, deadly. Several of the animals were slain. But the fate of their fallen comrades did not deter the survivors from continuing the strife. On the contrary, it but maddened them the more. The struggle became more and more confused—the coyotes crowding over one another to lay hold of their victim. The knife was wielded at random; the arm melding it every moment becoming weaker, and striking with less fatal effect. The disabled man was soon further disabled. He felt fear for his life. No wilder—death was staring him in the face. At this crisis a cry escaped his lips. Strange it was not one of terror, but joy! And stinger still that, on hearing it, the coyotes for an instant desisted from their attack! There was a suspension of the strife — a short interval of"

Boats, small craft, and means to construct, on a better plan than formerly, three floating bridges, were prepared and put in order in an incredibly short space of time.5 The former bridge, repaired so strongly as to have little to fear from the fury of the Danube, again connected the islands occupied by the French with the lefthand bank of that river; and so imperfect were the Austrian means of observation, though the campaign was fought within their own country, whose fate depended upon its issue, that they appear to have been ignorant of the possibility of Napoleon's using any other means of passage than this identical 1 ["" Malevolence has delighted in representing the Emperor as of a mistrustful character; and yet on this occasion, where illintentioned men might have made any attempt upon his person, his only guard at headquarters was the Portuguese legion, which watched as carefully over him as the veterans of the army of Italy could have done.'*—Savary, t. ii. pt. ii. p. 91.] 1 ["" General Bertrand, the Emperor's aide-de-camp, was the officer who executed this splendid work.

And there can be no doubt, as the pensions were sure to be expended in maintaining and increasing their patriarchal followers, and keeping them in readiness for action, it seems to have been considered by the chiefs, that the largesses were designed by Government for that, and no other purpose. The money was placed at the disposal of the Earl of Mar, Secretary of State, and his being the agent of this bounty, gave him the opportunity of improving and extending his influence among the Highland chiefs, afterwards so fatally employed for them and for himself. The construction which the chiefs put upon the bounty bestowed on them was clearly shown by their joining in a supplication to the Queen, about the end of the year 1713, which got the name of the Sword-in-hand Address. In one paragraph, they applaud the measures taken for repressing the license of the press, and trust that they should no longer be scandalized by hearing the Deity blasphemed, and the sacred race of Stewart traduced, with equal malice and impunity. In another, they expressed their hopes, that, after her Majesty's demise, ""the hereditary and parliamentary sanction might possibly meet in the person of a lineal successor.""

In answer to this the Treasurer Oxford alleged, "" That in this particular he had but followed the example of King William, who, after he had reduced the Highlanders, thought fit to allow yearly pensions to the heads of clans, in order to keep them quiet; and if the present Ministry could be charged with any mismanagement on that head, it was only for retrenching part of these gratuities.""

We have also hinted at some of the author's errors; and we must now, in all candour and respect, mention one of considerable importance, which the reader has perhaps anticipated. It respects the resemblance betwixt the character and fate of Zaira and Corinne —a coincidence so near, as certainly to deprive Mr Maturin of all claim to originality, so far as this brilliant and well-painted character is concerned. In her accomplishments, in her beauty, in her talents, in her falling a victim to the passion of a fickle lover, Zaira closely resembles her distin WOMEN; OR, POUR ET CONTRE. 203 guished prototype.

On the other hand, the full praise, both of invention and execution, must be allowed to Maturin's sketch of Eva—so soft, so gentle, so self-devoted—such a mixture of the purity of heaven with the simplicity of earth, concealing the most acute feelings under the appearance of devout abstraction, and unable to express her passion otherwise than by dying for it. The various impressions received by good and by bad dispositions from the profession of methodistical or evangelical tenets, form a curious chapter in the history of our modern manners.

Down we went in most imposing form, slow and silent, all incipient cheers and cries being cheoked at once by a look from the chiefs. Our opponents were the reverse of classic in their array. Clamour, tumult, independence of throat and action, characterised their rabble rout. They were all stripped to their shirts, were bare-headed, had handkerchiefs or bands braced round their waists, and some of them were rolling earth or grass betwixt their palms and fingers, under the idea that this gave greater tenacity to the clench of the fist. They, like ourselves, had their champions, who stood in front swaying their bared arms, and shouting out challenges for some one from our ranks to come out and exchange a blow. The most vociferous of these was the son of a small fanner, a big uncouth fellow, bulky and largelimbed, but awkward and ungainly, shuffling in his movements, and loose in his strength. As this Goliath vaunted and defied us, the phalanx advanced, and our captain, who was at the apex, stood face to face with him. Shorter and less bulky than his antagonist, he was more compact, more firmly knit, more sinewy, and more elastic; and the round smooth face, ruddy and glowing, shaded by short dark curls, and the bright brown eye, usually laughing and gladsome, but now look 8 TALES FROM ""BLACKWOOD."" ing forth calm and steady, were a contrast to the coarse massive features which now grinned and scowled defiance at him. Blows were exchanged and parried, and the fight was begun. As the phalanx swayed onwards, the town boys swarmed round, and it broke out in all parts. There was one lad, the champion of the junior classes and smaller boys—a daring reckless fellow, all dash and spring — to whom fighting was mirth and pastime, and ever and anon he would spring out on some foe, bound round in a series of attacks, finish the combat in a few rounds, or leave it unfinished, dashing on in the milee, giving a black eye here, a bloody nose there, knocking out the tooth of one, or tripping up the heels of another, and ever accompanying his blows with gibe and taunt after the Homeric fashion, but rather more in the Swiveller style as to elocution. Thus the fight went on for an hour or more. Our foes were hard, lusty, and plucky; but blood and bone and compactness began at last to tell. Our tactics were not to advance beyond our own line.

Once more under milder but equally generous springs of action, that fine mind was recovering its natural tone, though still weak. The important matters which summoned him to England, began to assume their due weight and influence. The Darcies were in safety; and much as he admired Norah, still as a young and lovely girl, living quietly with her parents, however amiable and attractive, she was no longer surrounded by the dangers and difficulties which had thrown around her a halo of romance, and awakened his chivalrous disposition.

Every shade of care or anxiety that might chequer the assumed cheerfulness of the one, was instantly reflected as in a mirror upon the expressive countenance of the other; one and the same ruling spirit appeared to control both. Sir Edwin now passed much of his time at the Mount, and as days flew past, the Petrel's whereabouts and her probable return to the Cape, were frequently discussed there.

Now Emma, though she was sufficiently obliging and polite towards her new acquaintance, was by no means enchanted with her; nor did she feel the least disposition suddenly to contract a friendship with a person she had seen but for a few hours.

At night, when Lady Augusta was preparing to depart, Helen slipped out of the room, packed up the things, and as Aboulcasem wrote a scroll with his presents, she thought it necessary to accompany hers with a billet.

I can understand how those who never fast, and who do not think (as our Church does) that it is “much to be wished” that the “ godly discipline” of primitive times should be restored again, set no store by Lent, and count it no privilege, or source of thankfulness, that a season has been set apart for them, wherein they may retire from the world, and give themselves up to offices of humiliation and prayer. It is intelligible that persons who are disposed to set their own judgments above that of the Church should allow what they look upon as an ordinance solely ecclesiastical to fall into desuetude and oblivion. It is intelligible, though it is hard to say how people can persuade themselves that they can despise the Church, without at the same time, despising the Church's Head. But where Passion-week is not observed, the neglect can hardly fail to arise not only from indifference to the privileges which the Church offers, but from deadness to religion, and low views of what has been achieved for us by the sacrifice of the Cross. At least it is strange that any can think of the innumerable benefits which Christ by His precious bloodshedding hath obtained for us, and fail to prepare himself duly for the yearly commemoration of that most awful event. I am thankful to say that my pious predecessors in the parish of Yateshull had never been so far seduced, by the apathy of former years, as to give up the services  EVENSONG. 123 which, from time immemorial, had been maintained in their church during Lent and Passiontide. True, the attendance during the former season was far below what it ought to have been, and there were not many of those who had to earn their daily bread that were to be found among the congregation ; their labours had called them forth until the evening. There is but one method by which the privileges of daily service can be brought within the reach of the poor; their matins and vespers must be performed at hours which will enable them to go forth to their labours in the strength of prayer, and to revisit the house of God when the toils of the day are over. It is a sad mistake to open our churches at hours when nobody but the idle and wealthy can attend them. Our prayers during Lent were therefore offered, as I have said, by a small congregation; for (according to old custom, which I had not then changed) they began at eleven in the forenoon; but in Passion-week it has been the usage for many years to celebrate the evening service at an hour when the labourers have returned from work; and the consequence is, that the church is as full as it is upon Sundays, throughout the week, and a more orderly and

This was the last of Biddy's audible complaints, for the remainder of this long and anxious watch of Mulford. He then set himself about an arrangement which shall be mentioned in its proper place. At twelve o'clock, or when he thought it was twelve, he called Jack Tier, who in turn called the mate again at four. “It looks dark and threatening,"" said Mulford, as he rose to his feet and began to look about him once more, “ though there does not appear to be any wind."" “It's a flat calm, Mr. Mate, and the darkness comes from yonder cloud, which seems likely to bring a little rain."" “Rain! Then God is indeed with us here. You are right, Jack; rain must fall from that cloud. We must catch some of it, if it be only a drop to cool Rose's parched tongue.” “In what ?"" answered Tier, gloomily. “She may wring her clothes when the shower is over, and in that way get a drop. I see no other method."" ""I have bethought me of all that, and passed most of my watch in making the preparations."" Mulford then showed Tier what he had been about, in the long and solitary hours of the first watch. It would seem that the young man had dug a little trench with his knife, along the schooner's boliom, commencing two or three feet from the keel, and near the spot where Rose was lying, and carrying it as far as was convenient toward the run, until he reached a point where he had dug out a sort of reservoir to contain the precious fluid, should any be sent them by Providence.

The travellers now crossed the river, by a narrow high arched bridge, and pursued their way for many miles through a deep forest of very large firs, sown by the hand of Nature herself, and exhibiting, in the bold bendings of their stems, and the wild luxuriance of their branches, all that freedom of growth in vain sought for in the formal modern plantations of the tree. Here they appeared like natives of the soil. The surface of the ground they grew on was varied with  208 knolls and banks, and hills, and hollows, covered with the glossy leaves of the trailing arbutus, and in the more open parts, the high tops of the distant Cairngorums broke upon the view, the dark green masses of the foliage being richly relieved against the pure white of their snowy summits. About six or eight miles of travel brought them into the great Strath of the Spey, where are the districts of Rothiemurchus and Badenoch. The magnificent scale that nature now appeared in, the breadth of the valley, the noble stream by which it is watered, the grandeur of the mountains bounding it, the immensity of its natural forests, the beauty of its numerous little lakes, every now and then bursting upon the eye, or seen glittering through the foliage, as they wound among the knolls of weeping birches, the lovely form and rich green of some of those isolated hills, rising in the middle of the landscape, the rocks hung with woods, together with a thousand more minute charms unfolding themselves at every turn, called forth Amherst's admiration, and filled his mind with sensations he had never before experienced. The sun was on the eve of going down as they entered a birch wood, through which they urged on their horses, with as much speed as the nature of the road, and the tired state of their animals would admit. Hamish, notwithstanding the length of the journey, trotted on before, with as much alacrity as he did the first minute they set out. Amherst expressed his surprise to Lochandhu. “Why, the fellow has got his foot on his native soil now,” replied he, “his pace is mended by it, and I'll warrant he would run down a horse ere he would tire.” . While they were yet speaking, a rustling was heard among the branches of the underwood, and a tall, athletic, and very handsome man in the Highland garb, sprang into the middle of the path. He was fully armed, with dirk and pistols in his belt, carried a long gun, and was followed by seven or eight men, dressed and accoutred in a similar, though somewhat inferior manner. One of these was the very man who had so earnestly eyed the young Englishman's purse at Macphie's. Amherst was startled by the sudden appearance of this formidable party, but he was relieved, by observing that Lochandhu considered them as friends.

Doctor Ferrier was once in a party of his brethren and a few of the Cameronian communion, going in one of the canal passage-boats, to join their respective Synods in Edinburgh, when there happened to be a passenger apparently much under the influence of ardent spirits. The manner, however, in which he was demeaning himself, showed that a considerable portion of his behaviour was put on, and drink the mask under which he chose to assail the clergymen. Every effort was made by him to insult the cloth, but they paid no attention to his rudeness. At last he came near whero a group of the ministers were standing conversing, and remarked, ""Well, it is singular, yes, it is, and so I am; yes, that I never get drunk, but in the company of your sober clergymen; no never."" Still no notice was taken,—round again came the assailant—"" Oh, yes, I never get drunk, but in the company of your sober clergymen."" ""Do you know,"" said Dr. Ferrier, turning round with a look both of pity and indignation, ""what is the reason that you never get drunk, but in the company you mention?"" ""No, I don't, but I suppose you can tell me."" ""Yes, I can, because there you get all the drink to yourself."" LITERARY HONOUR. When Doctor Ferrier received the literary honour of D, D. from America, some ladies made it a pleasant part of  288 LAIRD OF LOGAN. their duty to call and compliment the Doctor on the academic distinction bestowed on him. Wine was offered to the visitors, when the Doctor's health was toasted with wishes how long he might be spared to be useful in the church, and wear the literary wreath that had been fairly won by him. One of the ladies complimented him on the quality of his wine. ""Yes,"" replied the Doctor, ""it is good to a Degree."" A DRY BUB. The portions of human nature, covered with the sober black and par-respectful eminence, denominated "" the cloth,'' have their foibles,to call them by as soft terms as possible, and friendships are often broken up, or distances taken and raeasuredly kept for a time, fully as frequently as amongst the debtor and creditor children of commercial life.

Mahomet approached the sacred city   over the same heights which he had traversed in capturing it,   and he entered through the gate Beni Scheiba, which still bears   the name of The Holy.     A few days after his arrival he was joined by Ali, who had   hastened back from Yemen; and who brought with him a   number cf camels to be slain in sacrifice.

Being too weak and infirm to go on foot, he mounted   his camel, and thus performed the circuits round the Caaba,   and the journey ings to and fro, between the hills of Safa and   Merwa.     When the camels were to be offered up in sacrifice, he slew   aixby- three with Ins own hand, one for each year of his age,   and Ali, at the same time, slew thirty-seven on his own ac=   count.

Conscious that life was waning away within him, Mahomet,   during this last sojourn in the sacred city of his faith, sought   to engrave his doctrines deeply in the minds and hearts of his   followers. For this purpose he preached frequently in the   Caaba from the pulpit, or in the open air from the back of his   camel. ""Listen to my words,"" would he say, ""for I know   not whether, after tins year, we shall ever meet here again.   Oh, my hearers, I am but a man like yourselves ; the angel of   death may at any time appear, and I must obey his summons.""     He would then proceed to inculcate not merely religious doctrines and ceremonies, but rules for conduct in all the concerns   of life, public and domestic ; and the precepts laid down and   enforced on this occasion have had a vast and durable influence on the morals, manners, and habitudes of the whole Moslem world.

In short, Eoldan drew a picture of loose sensual   enjoyment such as he knew to be irresistible with men of idle   and dissolute habits. His followers acceded with joy to his   proposition. Some preparations, however, were necessary to   carry it into effect. Taking advantage of the absence of the   Adelantado, he suddenly marched with his band to Isabella,   and entering it in a manner by surprise, endeavored to launch   the caravel, with which they might sail to Xaragua. Don   Diego Columbus, hearing the tumult, issued forth with several   cavaliers ; but such was the force of the mutineers and their   menacing conduct, that he was obliged to withdraw, with his   adherents, into the fortress. Eoldan held several parleys with   him, and offered to submit to his command, provided he would   set himself up in opposition to his brother the Adelantado.   His proposition was treated with scorn. The fortress was too   strong to be assailed with success; he found it impossible to   launch the caravel, and feared the Adelantado might return,   and he be inclosed between two forces.

Parrots are very numerous in the East and West Indies, where they assemble in companies, like rooks, and build in the hollows of trees. The female lays two or three eggs, marked with little specks, like those of the partridge. They never breed in our climate, though they live here to a great age. They feed entirely upon vegetables, but, when tame, will take from the mouth of their master or mistress any kind of chewed meat, and chiefly eggs, of which they seem particularly fond. They bite or pinch very hard, and some of them possess so much strength in their beak, that they could easily break a man's finger.

Her shoes were pink satin; and her white cotton stockings would have been faultless, were it not for the open-work of their clocks, which betrayed the sable hue of a daughter of Africa. Her ear-rings were broad circles of gold, set with several ill-shaped and rather yellowish pearls ; and a long necklace of gold beads, to which several pieces of Spanish coin, both escúdos and pezétas, 31 were attached, hung down nearly to her waist. Her hair, which was perfectly woolly, had been tortured into various attempts at plaiting, which projected abruptly like short horns; setting at defiance the efforts of some dozen small tortoise-shell combs, which were stuck into different parts of the chevélure. Lodewyk introduced her as Máma Chepíta ; and informed Maria del Rosario that her hostess could understand and speak Spanish, as most West Indian negroes can. He then took his leave, promising to return the next day to enquire after the invalid, previous to sailing. The negress kissed her fair  160 THE EARTHQUAKE guest's hand, and led her through a small porch, into a room floored with bright red tiles. Its neatness astonished the emigrants ; for on hearing Sluiker mention a laundress's cottage, they had formed an idea of a miserable rancho, like those they had been accustomed to see at the outskirts of their native city. The windows were, of course, unglazed, on account of the excessive heat of the climate; but they were covered with muslin curtains, of so thin a texture, as to admit the breeze from the harbour, which the cottage overlooked. The chairs were cane-bottomed, and painted in imitation of bambu; and the table, which stood in the middle of the room, was of dark Honduras mahogany, brilliantly polished. Opposite the door was a small side-board, covered with glass of every description, cut and plain, ranged ostentatiously in rows, from the smallest sized liqueur-glasses, to rummers and sangría-cups. Behind all, towered those tall candle-shades, which are rather necessaries than luxuries in a tropical climate, where moths and other nocturnal insects swarm to such a degree, as instantly to extinguish an unguarded light. Máma Chepíta smiled with gratified vanity, at seeing the notice her young guests took of this piece of negro finery, which is rarely seen on the main, although extremely common on the islands.

Thus to adore idols and to kiss idols mean tho same thing. Indeed, the word adore signifies simply to carry the hand to the mouth, that is. to kiss it to the idol. We still kiss the hand in salutation. Various parts of tho body are kissed to distinguish the character of the adoration paid. Thus, to kiss the lips is to adore the living breath of the person saluted; to kiss the feet or ground is to humble oneself in adoration; to kiss the garments is to express veneration to whatever belongs to or touches the person who wears thorn. ""Kiss the Son, lest He be angry"" (Ps. ii. 12), means Worship the Son of God. Pharaoh tells Joseph, ""Thou shalt be over my house, and npon thy mouth shall all my people kiss,"" moaning they shall reverence the commands of Joseph by kissing the roll on which his commands wouldbewritten. ""Samuel poured oil on Saul, and kissed him,"" to acknowledge subjection to God's anointed (1 Sam. x. 1). In the Hebrew state, this mode of expressing reverence arose from the form of government established, whether under the patriarchal or matrimonial figure. A Judas kin. An act of treachery.

All those things which seemed mere matter of course in society appeared to Forester strange ceremonies. In the evening there were cards for those who liked cards, and there was conversation for those who liked conversation. Forester liked neither; he preferred playing with a cat; and he sat all night apart from the company in a corner of a sofa. He took it for granted that the conversation could not be worth his attention, because he heard Lady Catherine Mackenzie's voice among others; he had conceived a dislike, or rather a contempt for this lady, because she showed much of the pride of birth and rank in her manners. Henry Campbell did not think it necessary to punish himself for her ladyship's faults by withdrawing from entertaining conversation; he knew that his father had the art of managing the frivolous subjects started in general company, so as to make them lead to amusement and instruction; and this Forester would probably have discovered this evening, had he not followed his own thoughts, instead of listening to the observations of others. Lady Catherine, it is true, began with a silly history of her hereditary antipathy for pickled cucumbers; and she was rather tiresome in tracing the genealogy of this antipathy through several generations of her ancestry; but Dr. Campbell said ""that he had heard, from an ingenious gentleman of her ladyship's family, that her ladyship's grandfather, and several of his • La Valiant's Travels in Africa, vol. i. p. 114. r  I2 FORESTER.  friends, nearly lost their lives by pickled cucumbers,"" and thence the doctor took occasion to relate several curious circumstances concerning the effects of different poisons. Dr. Campbell, who plainly saw both the defects and the excellent qualities of his young ward, hoped that, by playful raillery and by well-timed reasoning, he might mix a sufficient portion of good sense with Forester's enthusiasm; might induce him gradually to sympathize in the pleasures of cultivated society, and might convince him that virtue is not confined to any particular class of men; that education, in the enlarged sense of the word, creates the difference between individuals more than riches or poverty. He foresaw that Forester would form a friendship with his son, and that this attachment would cure him of his prejudices against gentlemen, and would prevent him from indulging his taste for vulgar company. Henry Campbell had more useful energy,though less apparent enthusissm, than his new companion: he was always employed; he was really independent, because he had learned how to support himself either by the labours of his bead or of his hands; but his independence did not render him unsociable; he was always ready to sympathize with the pleasures of his friends, and therefore he was beloved: following his lather's example, he did all the good in his power to those who were in distress; but he did not imagine that he could reform every abuse in society, or that lie could instantly new-model"

Almeria had indeed almost decided in her favour, when she received a note from a Mrs. Wynne, an old lady with whom she had formerly been acquainted in Yorkshire, and who, being just come to town, was eager to renew her intimacy with Miss Turnbull. She was a woman of an excellent heart, and absolutely incapable of suspecting that others could be less frank or friendly than herself. She was sometimes led into mistakes by this undistinguishing benevolence ; for she imagined that all which appeared wrong would prove right, if properly understood; that there must be some good reason for every thing that seemed to be bad ; that every instance of unkindness or insolence was unde signed; and that every quarrel was only a misunderstanding. Possessed by this good-natured kind of wrong-headedness, she frequently did the most pro ALMERIA. 223 · voking, by way of doing the most obliging things imaginable. Upon this principle she would place contending parties by surprise in the very situation which of all others they most wished to avoid, and then gave the signal for a pitched battle, by begging the enemies would shake hands with one another. Now she had heard it reported in Yorkshire that there was some coolness between the Elmours and Miss Turnbull; but she was morally certain there could be no truth in this report, for a variety of the very best reasons in the world. “In the first place,” argued Mrs. Wynne,“ to my certain knowledge, Miss Turnbull was, from her infancy, always the greatest favourite at Elmour Grove, the pupil of the good old gentleman, and the intimate friend of the daughter. During that odd Hodgkinson's lifetime, Almeria was always with Miss Ellen Elmour, who treated her quite like a sister. I am sure I remember, as if it was yesterday, her introducing Miss Turnbull to me, and the affectionate way in which she spoke of her; and I particularly recollect hearing Almeria Turnbull, among other grateful things, say, that she should wish to live and die with her friends at Elmour Grove. Then she had stronger reasons afterward for being attached to them-you know it was Mr. Frederick Elmour who gained her large fortune for her. I was in the courthouse in York the very day the cause was decided, and I never heard a man speak with more energy and eloquence than Frederick Elmour did in her defence. It was plain, indeed, that the eloquence came from his heart; as to the law part of the business, I know my nephew, who understands those things, said it was a very nice question, and that if her cause had not been managed as ably as it was, she would not have gained her fortune.

She was perfectly at ease in Mr. Vincent's company, because she consid. ered him as a person who wished for her friendship, without having any design to engage her affections. From several hints that dropped from him, from Mr. Percival, and from Lady Anne, she was persuaded that he was attached to some creole lady; and all that he said in favour of the elegant softness and delicacy of his countrywomen confirmed this opinion.

On the contrary, it is evident that the Dean, however desirous of being removed to England, was so far from stooping to solicit it as a favour, that he did not even seek another interview with Walpole, though it was indirectly offered, for the sake of stating his wishes more plainly. Walpole, offended by his indifference, little gratified, probably, by the hints in the Travels to Liliput, now broke off all communication.* Per* The story has been retailed with more or less credible circumstances, according to the faith of the narrator. Lord Chesterfield, probably with a view of mystifying his credulous audience, pretended that Chartrcs (whom Swift regarded with the ntmost abhorrence,) acted as master of the ceremonies when the Dean of St Patrick's offered to barter his political faith for church preferment. To the utter improbability of this tale in itself, it may be added, that we know, from Swift's correspondence, that he met with Walpole only twice,—once by invitation to dinner, and once at an audience upon the public business of Ireland, when he was introduced by Lord Peterborow. A more modest edition of the legend bears, that Swift only indicated his wishes to the minister by pointing to a tree which was bearing down the wall against which it leaned, and observed, that he, like that tree, needed support; an attack which Wal 350 MEMOIRS OF haps, also, he considered Swift as privately caballing with Pulteney and Bolingbroke, perhaps having found the road to the prince's good graces, through the interest of the princess, he chose to keep no measures with the little band of literaryfriends who had attached themselves to Mrs Howard. Swift had previously intimated, that, if he was not better treated by the minister this year than the last, he would take vengeance""; and accordingly, within a few weeks after his arrival in England, we find him engaged in a paper to be sent to the Craftsman, the general channel for assault upon Walpole.* In this epistle, which pole parried, by answering, "" Then why, Doctor, did you at. tach yourself to a falling wall?"" A third statement transfers the simile of the tree, with some variation, to Walpole. Swift is said bluntly to have asked Sir Robert to remove him, for God's sake, from that wretched country of Ireland, and the minister replied by pointing to a fruit-tree, which, he said, was ruined by being transplanted from a hungry soil to a richer one. Both these last stories would imply a wish, on the part of Walpole, to refuse Swift's request with irony and sarcasm, which is altogether inconsistent with the opening which he held out to Pope. It must be added, that Mr Coxe, though abundantly severe upon Swift, in general, makes no mention of any such disgraceful transactions as are charged upon him by these stories.

They helped Libbie to bring her round ; but long after her half-opened eyes and altered breathings showed that her senses were restored, she lay, speechless and motionless, without attempting to rise from her strange bed, as if the earth contained nothing worth even that trifling exertion. At last Libbie and she left that holy, consecrated spot, and bent their steps back to the only place more consecrated still-where he had rendered up his spirit; and where memories of him haunted each common, rude piece of furniture that their eyes fell upon. As the woman of the house opened the door, she pulled Libbie on one side, and said : “Anne Dixon has been across to see you ; she wants to have a word with you.” “I cannot go now,” replied Libbie, as she pushed hastily along, in order to enter the room (his room) at the same time with the childless mother : for, as she had anticipated, the sight of that empty spot, the glance at the uncurtained open window, letting in the fresh air, and the broad, rejoicing light of day, where all had so long been darkened and subdued, unlocked the waters of the fountain, and long and shrill were the cries for her boy that the poor woman uttered. “Oh! dear Mrs. Hall,” said Libbie, herself drenched in tears, R 2  244 LIBBIE MARSH'S THREE ERAS. “ do not take on so badly ; I'm sure it would grieve him sore if he were alive, and you know he is–Bible tells us so; and maybe he's here watching how we go on without him, and hoping we don't fret over much.” Mrs. Hall's sobs grew worse and more hysterical. “Oh! listen,” said Libbie, once more struggling against her ow? increasing agitation, “listen! there's Peter chirping as he always does when he's put about, frightened like ; and you know he that's gone could never abide to hear the canary chirp in that shrill way.” Margaret Hall did check herself, and curb her expressions of agony, in order not to frighten the little creature he had loved ; and as her outward grief subsided, Libbie took up the large old Bible, which fell open at the never-failing comfort of the fourteenth chapter of St. John's Gospel. How often these large family Bibles do open at that chapter! as if, unused in more joyous and prosperous times, the soul went home to its words of loving sympathy when weary and sorrowful, just as the little child seeks the tender comfort of its mother in all its griefs and cares. And Margaret put back her wet, ruffled, grey hair from her heated, tear-stained, woeful face, and listened with such earnest eyes, trying to form some idea of the “Father's house” where her boy had gone to dwell.

The threat of enforcing obedience to her last commands from beyond the grave, which the mistress had uttered in mocking experiment on the superstitious fears of the credulous maid, now hung darkly over the weak mind of Sarah, as a judgment which might descend on her, visibly and inexorably, at any moment of her future life. When she roused herself at last, and pushed away the paper, and rose to her feet, she stood quite still for an instant, before she ventured to look behind her. When she did look, it was with an effort and a start, with a searching distrust of the empty dimness in the remoter corners of the room. Her old habit of talking to herself began to resume its influence, as she now walked rapidly backwards and forwards, sometimes along the room and sometimes across it. She repeated incessantly such broken phrases as those “How can I give him the letter? — Such a good master; so kind to us all. — Why did she die, and leave it all to me? — I can't bear it alone; it's too much for me.” While reiterating these sentences, she vacantly occupied herself in putting things about the room in order, which were set in perfect order already. All her looks, all her actions, betrayed the vain struggle of a weak mind to sustain itself under the weight of a heavy  THE DEAD SECRET. 23 responsibility. She arranged and rearranged the cheap china ornaments on her chimney-piece a dozen times over — put her pin-cushion first on the looking-glass, then on the table in front of it — changed the position of the little porcelain dish and tray on her wash-handstand, now to one side of the basin and now to the other. Throughout all these trifling actions, the natural grace, delicacy, and prim neat-handedness of the woman still waited mechanically on the most useless and aimless of her occupations of the moment. She knocked nothing down, she put nothing awry, her footsteps at their fastest made no sound — the very skirts of her dress were kept as properly and prudishly composed as if it was broad daylight and the eyes of all her neighbours were looking at her. From time to time the sense of the words she was murmuring confusedly to herself changed. Sometimes they disjointedly expressed bolder and more self-reliant thoughts. Once they seemed to urge her again to the dressing-table and the open letter on it, against her own will. She read aloud the address: “To my Husband,” and caught the letter up sharply, and spoke in firmer tones. “Why give it to him at all? Why not let the secret die with her and die

But Geraldine was roused; and, like most timid people, was more reckless, more careless of consequences and more impossible to over-bear than the naturally brave and self-assertive. Her latent power of will must have been roused indeed, when it could sweep down Mrs. Amphlett's sternest and angriest opposition. “You wrote these letters,” continued Geraldine, laying her finger on the packet; “and as you have spoken of Miss Waughan and cousin Henry, I wish them to give Arthur their version of the same stories. Miss Waughan,”  352 THE AMPHILETT LOVE-MATCH. she said, speaking in the same rapid and positive voice, “did you ever reprove me for undue familiarity with my cousin Henry?” And she read the passage from the letter, referring to Miss Waughan having crushed Geraldine with one of her lofty looks, because of cousin Hal. “Why, no,” said that lady deliberately, dropping her lorgnon, and unbuttoning her gauntlet gloves; “I do not remember ever speaking to you on the subject; but I certainly did say to Mrs. Amphlett, that I thought it scarcely proper that you should ride so much with Captain Aztler: and indeed, to tell the truth, it was to prevent anything unpleasant being said that I have gone so much with you of late. I thought you were ignorant of the world, and I could not understand your mother's indifference to appearances — or probabilities,” she added in the same careless way as she would have spoken of a rent opera cloak or a damaged riding whip. “Mrs. Amphlett!” cried Geraldine, turning full on her mother-in-law, “was it not you — yourself — who, when I objected to ride alone with my cousin, scolded me for my presumption in holding an opinion contrary to yours? Have you not thrown me into my cousin's way as you would into a brother's? Those were your words: you said he was to be my brother, and that I was to treat him with unreserved affection.” “I am afraid, Aunt Amphlett, that you have been playing rather a double game!” said Harry; whose goodhumoured, frank, manly voice came like a charm into the midst of all this tense and nervous feminine excitement. “Arthur,” he added, “do you come with me: your wife can stay with Miss Waughan.

The old man had not even heard of his young massa's illness ; and most affecting it was to witness the unfeigned woe with which he knelt at the bedside, and prayed,  THE FIFTH GRAVE. 119 in his own simple language, that the Saviour would uphold his servant in death's dark waters. “ I think I see him now, his white hair presenting a striking contrast with his dark cheeks, whilst the tears were rolling down his face, ‘Hush, missis, hush!' he said, hearing my sobs, and becoming at once attached to me by the viewless chain with which sympathy connects all sorrowing hearts, Hush, missis !

My father considers, the very fact of such a a question being mooted in the House of Commons is sapping our colonial security at its foundations. Good old Mr. Venn, of Huddersfield, had written to aunt Ellie, saying how he blessed God that the wrongs of injured Africa seemed to have come up in remembrance before Him. Mr. Wilberforce is first and foremost in this parliamentary contention, and is very eloquent on the subject—aunt Ellie says, with that kind of eloquence a man has when his soul speaks. Papa has been reading to us a speech he made in the house. My mother insists that he speaks impulsively, and from feeling; that he knows nothing of the real state of things in the West Indian colonies. Papa does not say much, but looks uneasy; and Hugh declares boldly enough that truth is stamped on every line of Mr. Wilberforce's speech; that slavery is certainly opposed to the genius and spirit of the Gospel, which tends to unite all mankind in the bonds and fellowship of love; and when mamma expressed it as her conviction that slaves had been allowed from time immemorial, the Israelites holding them under the very command of the Almighty, he quoted that passage from Deuteronomy—“In the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee, and when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty.”  136 Years Ago. I don't know what mamma thought of this. She made no direct reply. I rather think she was afraid of having any argument from which the negroes might draw some notion that we were thinking and talking of their freedom. October 23rd. Aunt Ellie spent all the morning with us. Dear soul! she came full of importance, to read to us her letter from Mr. Venn. This old gentleman is a great friend of one William Cowper, a man of great learning, and of most elegant mind and fancy. He is, indeed, no common poet. He has just finished a translation of Homer, which they say bids fair to surpass every other work of the kind in the English language. Mr. Cowper has sent papa, through Mr. Venn, a manuscript copy of some lines he is about to publish. Now, whilst papa naturally is pleased and flattered at this attention from a man of such literary note as William Cowper, I can see very well he is abashed at the idea, that through this gift a gentle reproof is conveyed to him ; at all events, as a reminder to him of the dreadful traffic with which he certainly has some little connexion. I copy in my Diary part of this poem. Aunt Ellie says I am right to do so, that I may look at it at some future time, when freedom is bright as the sunshine of this degraded Island. Yes, these were the very words she used; and papa smiled, but very gravely,

In June, 1771, Mr. Fisher, superintendant of the Empress Catharine's Theatre, at St. Petersburgh, offered Mr. Garrick two thousand guineas for four performances at that place, which, of course, were refused.—About the same time, a full-length picture of this great actor was painted in London, by order of the King of Denmark, to be placed in his palace at Copenhagen.

At the Salisbury Music Meeting, in 1793, while this distinguished singer was executing a very complicated embellishment in the song of "" He was despised,"" a Quaker-lady, well-known in that city, entered the middle aisle of the cathedral, in the heart of these vocal evolutions, and lifting up her eyes and hands, very loudly ejaculated, ""It is all idolatry, and vain profanation,"" The effect of this serio-comic interference was too ludicrous to be conveyed by description.

It is an old and true maxim, that ridicule is by no means a'test of-truth, and- yetrit is an equally ancient remark, that many a serious truth has been put out of countenance by ridicule, and that ridicule not supported by wit or humour.— In a song of Garrick's, sung by Mrs. Cibber, there was this line— ""The roses will bloom when there's^peace in the breast,"" .^ of the justice of which no man can entertain a doubt. Foote, however, parodied the line thus:— ""The turtles will coo when there's peas in the craw,"" and actually destroyed the popularity of the song. MACKLIN, Sitting one night at the back of the front boxes with a friend, before the alterations at Covent Garden took place, a lobby lounger stood up immediately before them, and his person being rather large, prevented a sight of the stage. Macklin took fire at this, but managing his passion with more temper than usual, patted the intruder on the shoulder with his cane, and gently requested him, ""when any thing entertaining occurred upon the stage, to let him and his friend be apprized of it; for you see, my dear sir,"" said the veteran, "" that at present we must totally depend upon your kindness.""

I only gazed upon the moon, I could not look into her face, I could not meet her deep eyes' glance, Or dare her passing thoughts to trace. I murmur'd words—they might be wild — Of daydreams I had loved to seeOne word she spoke in careless tones — I turn'd—she did not smile on me!

A thorn was ever in my breast, To rankle there and yield distress ; A herb was ever in life's cup, Which turn’d its drops to bitterness. Thus days, and months, and years roll’d on, (Those years, alas ! how feebly spent,) Then o'er my spirit came a change, And from my life the shadows went. Into a graveyard once I stray'd, To gaze upon the tombstones there, And saw how frail a thing is life, How fleeting all we deem most fair!

And forth into the world I went, An alter'd and a wiser man, And on the Future all intent, A new existence I began. More earnestly I look'd on life, And less on earth, and more on heaven, And learn’d that in denying self A purer, calmer peace is given. Life was not as it erst had been, A gloomy and embitter'd thing, For I had burst my prison-bars, And I was free to sit and sing. And once again I saw that form, And once again that voice I heard ; I did not dare to linger near, Too deeply were my heart-strings stirr’d.

The tenderness of his manners, and the anxiety he expressed at the slight complaints of indisposition which Julia made, as an excuse for her languor and want of spirits, soon called forth those smiles of sweetness and good humour that were visible, even in the moments of her affiction.

He was animated by the vivacity of his infant com. panions; he talked with them, romped with them, and caressed them, till his sensations were elevated to rapture, and his wife recovered her ac. customed gaiety and cheerfulness. At this period a servant entered the apartment, and presented a letter to Mrs. Earlvin. . ” From the country, I suppose ?” said Julia. “ No, madam,” replied the man; "" it was delivered by a footman whom I do not recollect to have ever seen before.” Felix involuntarily gave over the amusement in which he was engaged with his eldest boy, and fixed his eyes earnestly on his wife. i “ I am entirely unacquainted with the hand,"" continued Mrs. Earlvin, as she gazed on the sus perscription.  JEALOUSY. 231 Felix's countenance betrayed emotion, and the child complained that he did not mind his play. Mrs. Earlvin opened the letter, which contained two cards, and a few lines in the 'envelope. She inquired if the footman waited for an answer. The servant replied in the negative, and left the room. Julia instantly handed the paper to her husband. “ They are tickets,” said she, “ for a 'grand masquerade, which is to be given tomorrow evening at the opera-house.

After a few minutes of this embarrassing situation, a black girl appeared on the scene, advanced timidly to Mahomet Sous, uttered a few words in a low tone, and vanished. The Turk, with an upward glance, gave an order, which was obeyed by a slave, who left the room and soon returned bearing a tray heaped with food. This he set down beside Billy. “Eat,” commanded Mahomet Sous, and our lad was hungry enough to accept the ungracious invitation, which had only been given that he might afford further amusement to the invisible spectators in the gallery. Unprovided with a utensil of any sort, he was obliged to explore the dish with his fingers. Nor had he an idea of what he was eating. Whatever it was, it seemed to be flavored with cosmetics; but he was too ravenous to mind a little thing like that, and  180 IN PIRATE WATERS so ate heartily, to the great delight of the ladies, as evidenced by titters of laughter. With this performance the show concluded, and Billy was again conducted to the slave yard, where he was left to find such sleeping-quarters as he could.  CHAPTER XXII BILLY MINISTERS TO HIS FELLOW-SLAVES AFTER our hero had served as a show for the entertainment of his master's harem, he wandered for some time about the slave yard, wondering how he should bestow himself for the night. The whole place was indescribably filthy; and, as seen by the moonlight, every spot in it available for sleeping purposes seemed to be already occupied by man or beast. Several of the former, over whom he inadvertently stumbled, called down on him such bitter curses for having awakened them, that he concluded not to take a sleeping-berth in their vicinity, at any rate. Finally, as a last resort, he began to try the doors giving upon the yard, with the hope of obtaining an entrance into some storeroom, where he might rest his weary body. After several failures, his efforts in this direction were crowned with success, and a door opened to him. As he stepped cautiously inside, a ray of moonlight disclosed this to be the very place in which he had recently been outfitted with clothing. At the same moment he was startled by a groan that came from the floor close at hand. 181  182 IN PIRATE WATERS A slight investigation discovered its author to be the young slave who had been so unfortunate as to spill scalding tea over Mahomet Sous, and had been sentenced to the torture of the bastinado in consequence. He had evidently fainted under the awful punishment, and then been thrown into this place to recover or die, as the case might be. Billy proved his identity by pulling the senseless form slightly forward into the moonlight, which also disclosed the sufferer's condition. The soles of his feet,

In the meantime Sandoval, visiting the Tlascalan quarters, found the fierce warriors very angry, and inclined to quarrel with some one, on account of the loss of their well-liked young chief. They could form no idea of what had become of him, but declared that if he were not restored to them soon, and in safety, the city that had swallowed him should be made to feel their vengeance. The matter was becoming so serious that it must be reported to Cortes. Upon hearing of it, the Spanish leader declared his intention of immediately visiting the king, and demanding any information he might possess upon the  SANDOVAL PLIGHTS HIS TROTH 175 subject. To this end, he summoned Marina to accompany him as interpreter. The Indian girl had but just discovered the page who had brought her the message, and gained from him the information that it had been sent by one of the court ladies, who was even now walking in the king's gardens, and to whom he would willingly conduct her. As Marina must attend the Conqueror in his audience with the king, she turned the page over to Sandoval, with instructions to lead the young cavalier to the gardens instead of herself, and point the lady out to him. Then the same party, that had made a tour of the city that morning, set forth for Montezuma's palace. After they had entered its grounds, Sandoval, keeping a tight hold of his page, managed to slip away unnoticed. He was pleasantly conscious that at length he, like other young men whom he had known, was setting forth in search of a romantic adventure. The feeling was an entirely novel one; for the plain-faced young soldier, though expert in the art of war, was awkward of speech, and so diffident that, since his childhood, he had hardly exchanged a dozen words with any woman. Marina was, of course, excepted, but he regarded her more in the light of a fellow-soldier than as a member of the dreaded sex. He wondered if the woman he was about to see would be old or young, attractive or otherwise. He  176 THE WHITE CONQUERORS finally decided that she would be middle-aged, as dark-skinned as were most of the Indian women he had seen, and that she was probably the wife of some court noble, who had let drop a chance expression concerning Don Juan, which she had misunderstood. While thus cogitating, Sandoval was led through a maze of shaded alleys and perfumed shrubberies until he was as bewildered as one without a compass in mid-ocean. At length, after a long search, he and the page detected the sound of voices; and, as they emerged from behind a dense thicket of laurel, the latter pointed, with a triumphant air, to two female figures pacing slowly along the borders of a miniature lake, and engaged in earnest conversation. One was dark, middle-aged, and stately. She answered

You know he has more than once, in a frolic, passed for my elder brother; and certainly has more sensibility than should belong to forty-five.

You ask me if I am not disgusted with her brogue? If she had one, 1 doubt not but I should? but the accent to which we English apply that term, is here generally confined to the lower orders of society; and I certainly believe, that purer and more grammatical English is spoken generally through Ireland than in any part of England whatever; for here you are never shocked by the barbarous unintelligible dialect peculiar to each shire in England. As to Glorvina, an aptitude to learn languages is, you know, peculiar to her country; but in her it is a decided and striking talent: even her Italian is, ""la lingua Toscana net' bocca Romana;"" and her English, grammatically correct, and elegantly pure, is spoken with an accent that could never denote her country. But it is certain, that in that accent there is a species of langour very distinct from the brevity of ours. Yet (to me at least) it only renders the lovely speaker more interesting. A simple question from her lip seems rather tenderly to solicit, than abruptly to demand. Her every request is a soft supplication; and when she stoops to entreaty, there is in her voice and manner such an energy of supplication, that while she places your power to grant"

Thus I have known bottled porter administered profusely, and with the best effect, by a medical man of eminence, to a brother of the profession (his junior, be it remarked,) during the progress of a bilious fever and flux; while the exhibition of poison could not have been more strictly prohibited than this seducing beverage to patients of a different temperament, afflicted with the same disease, and the same general symptoms, and whose only diluent was toast and water or ptisan. The great havoc in these climates, it must be confessed, falls on the regimental officers, whose duties, even under the mild administration of the most humane and considerate commander-in-chief, are at all times necessarily severe and trying in all the islands. The enemy had, at the period referred to, a considerable force in the West Indies, and their emissaries were active in their attempts to incite the coloured population of the lately conquered islands to rise against their new masters. To counteract these machinations, every measure which a humane and sound policy could suggest was adopted by those prudent and vigilant officers, to whom the safety of these important conquests was intrusted. The arrangements being complete, the grand expedition to the Spanish Main (as it was understood by the troops) sailed from Martinique and Barbadoes, joined by other forces from islands to leeward. I have already declared that it forms no part of my plan to enter into the details of battles by land or sea; the events of the late war have heen historically detailed by a variety of persons better qualified for the task than a young subaltern of my then standing in the service, who could only speak of those circumstances coming within that circumscribed sphere of action which added Trinidad to the British transatlantic dominions.

If there is not the fiery  286 LAIRD or Logan. volcanic energy of Robert Hall, there is something approaching him in majesty, concentration, and elegance of expression. No one relished social intercourse more than the Doc. tor, and his friends recollect the playful sallies of his refined wit and humour. It is said that, when a probationer, he spent a considerable portion of an evening with the celebrated Robert Burns, and that the poet had expressed himself much pleased with the young preacher's manners, and in his own paraphrastic manner, said, “He had spent twa three pleasant hours wi' a most excellent body o' divinity, elegantly bound and lettered.” A Logical. Deduction. Doctor Ferrier had a most thorough contempt for eve: y expression that savoured of cant, and often found fitting opportunities amongst his flock for touching the sore with his gentle caustic. The Doctor met with a serious fracture in one of his legs, he had taken a carriage for the purpose of escorting a party of ladies, and on returning home to the neighbourhood of the Sneddon, just as the ladies had left the carriage, and the driver was folding up the steps and fastening the carriage door, a flash of lightning scared the horses, and off they started at their utmost speed, snorting and plunging. The Doctor, knowing that some loose stones had been laid down at a new building, in the street up which they were running, and thence calculating on the certainty of being overturned when they should come up to that point, leapt out from the carriage, which was the occasion of the accident above stated. The fractured limb took a considerable time to knit together, and gain sufficient strength, so as to enable it to take a share with its brother locomotive in out or in-door duties, and, in the interim, the inquiries and sympathies of his flock were unceasing.

'Hang it, we'll show them we're not afraid. Attention! left wheel! march!' The police troopers and foot constables, who are always instructed in infantry drill at an early stage of their career, immediately stepped out after the immovable British fashion, making as if they were about to advance in the very teeth of the aroused multitude. Merlin himself, on his grey Arab, rode on at their head as though he had the command of something like an equal force. We could hear him say, 'Steady, men, mark time!' as the little band executed their manoeuvre with most creditable precision. The Commissioner, with his usual expression of half humorous gravity, loungingly sat on his well-known horse, close to whose feet his greyhounds crowded, looking wistfully at the multitude as if, with the fine instinct of their species, they had divined that a storm was imminent. So invariably accustomed were the greater portion of the people to render implicit submission to the law as represented by the personages now present, that even when their absurd inadequacy as combatants was so sharply contrasted, a curious feeling of schoolboy shamefacedness and moral inferiority was uppermost for the moment. Then the reactionary element prevailed, and with a mingled sentiment of admiration for the dauntless front of the small army of regulars and a half painful derision of their own instinctive deference, a storm of cheers burst from the multitude, which was taken up again and again, till the forest rang to its mountain buttresses. The Commissioner promptly seized the opportunity, and in a sonorous, resolute voice addressed them. 'Sorry to see you here, men, in open defiance of the law, threatening the Queen's representatives.

You have richly merited your sufferings, Pat. I shall, of course, stop the allowance, and take away the child from you.

Besides, he'd a hope left, of getting into grace again by good conduct;-so to work he went like a Trojan. Larry came down as hard as he could after Pat, determined to ruin him or make him knock under again: but  UNDER THE THUMB. 251 when he got to the village, Pat was back from The Beg, and had tould all his neighbours what he'd been doing; so that they hadn't much the laugh of him; and as Pat wasn't disliked, the boys and girls made such a mudlark of Larry, nobody could tell the colour of his coat. Pat began to prosper, and, by-and-by, got on well enough : in a year or two after, the little girl walked into his cabin one day, with a goulden guinea in her hand, and has lived under Pat's roof ever since.

After talking for some time with tender affection about the dear departed one, Mr. Newberry asked Martin what were his own intentions and prospects. He told him of his interview that morning with Messrs.

He then asked his pastor's advice about his relations to Kate; he had known for some time that they were engaged, as well as the fierce opposition of Aunt Sarah to their union. Martin related to Mr. Newberry the adventure of the preceding evening, told him the difficulty they had in meeting, of Aunt Sarah's unkind treatment of her niece, and of her harsh judgment respecting himself. Mr. Newberry said he would think the matter over. Although Martin, who now came in for his father's savings, which were not inconsiderable, was, so far as money was concerned, able to support a wife, yet the parson thought he was fully young to marry yet, and that it would be advisable to wait for a couple of years, perhaps till he attained the post of master. He was but twentyone, and had plenty of time before him. As to Kate, he would try to see her aunt and persuade her to listen to reason; she had no right, he felt, to exercise such despotic authority over her niece as to control her affections and blight her prospects in life. Next day was Sunday, and Martin requested Mr. Newberry to mention his name before the general thanksgiving as one who desired to offer up his “praises and thanksgivings for late mercies vouchsafed to him.” As he was leaving the house he met Jack, who told him he had just been to Willis & Dobbs' office; he was in high glee, for he had been praised and complimented on his bravery and good conduct, and been told that his pay would continue all the time he was on shore, because as he would have to appear as a witness at the inquiry they could not give him a berth on board one of their vessels till it was over.

The author, sensible of these difficulties, solicits indulgence for such errors as have escaped her vigilance. In a former work the author has endeavoured to add something to the increasing stock of innocent amusement and early instruction which the laudable exertions of some excellent modern writers provide for the rising generation; and in the present an attempt is made to provide for young people of a more advanced age a few tales that shall neither dissipate the attention nor inflame the imagination. In a work upon education which the public has been pleased to notice, we have endeavoured to show that under proper management amusement and instruction may accompany each other through many paths of literature, while at the same time we have disclaimed and reprehended all attempts to teach in play. Steady untired attention is what alone produces excellence. Sir Isaac Newton, with as much truth as modesty, attributed to this faculty those discoveries in science which brought the heavens within the grasp of man, and weighed the  PREFACE earth in a balance. To inure the mind to athletic vig our is one of the chief objects of good education; and we have found, as far as our limited experience has extended, that short and active exertions, interspersed with frequent agreeable relaxation, form the mind to strength and endurance better than long-continued feeble study. Hippocrates, in describing the robust temperament, tells us that the athlete prepare themselves for the gymnasium by strong exertion, which they continued till they felt fatigue ; they then reposed till they felt returning strength and aptitude for labour : and thus, by alternate exercise and indulgence, their limbs acquired the firmest tone of health and vigour. We have found that those who have tasted with the keenest relish the beauties of Berquin, Day, or Barbauld, pursue a demonstration of Euclid, or a logical deduction, with as much eagerness, and with more rational curiosity, than is usually shown by students who are nourished with the hardest fare and chained to unceasing labour. “ Forester"" is the picture of an eccentric charactera young man who scorns the common forms and dependencies of civilized society; and who, full of visionary schemes of benevolence and happiness, might, by improper management or unlucky circumstances, have become a fanatic and a criminal. The scene of "" The Knapsack” is laid in Sweden, to produce variety, and to show that the rich and poor the young and old, in all countries, are mutually serviceable to each other; and to portray some of those virtues which are peculiarly amiable in the character of a soldier. “ Angelina” is a female Forester.

With this view she formed a scheme which was to be kept a profound secret from the parties concerned, till the moment when it should be ripe for execution. She heard that Miss Turnbull was in want of a companion; and she knew that Mrs. Henry Elmour, a very amiable young widow, distantly related to the Elmour family, and who had formerly been a friend of Almeria's, was at this moment in great distress. She had no doubt that Miss Turnbull would be delighted with an opportunity of serving any one connected with a family to whom she owed such obligations. Mrs. Wynne fancied that this would be the finest occasion imaginable to prove to her nephew, that notwithstanding Almeria had lately lived so much in the fashionable world, she had the same grateful heart as formerly. Eager to come to this demonstration, Mrs. Wynne wrote immediately to the distressed widow, begging her to come to town with all possible expedition ; "" for I have found, or at least I am morally sure of finding, the most charming situation your heart can desire. I say no more, that I may not deprive you of the pleasure of the surprise."" The same day that she sent this letter to the post, she despatched the following note to Almeria: “MY DEAR Miss TURNBULL, “1 am too well persuaded of the goodness of your heart to fear that you should think my present interference impertinent.

Surely it is much better to let their natural affections have time to expand. If we A 3  10 BELINDA. tear the rosebud open we spoil the flower.” Belinda smiled at this parable of the rosebud, which, she said might be applied to men and women, as well as to children. “And yet, upon reflection,"" said Lady Anne, ""the heart has nothing in common with a rosebud. Nonsensical allusions pass off very prettily in conversation. I mean, when we converse with partial friends : but we should reason ill, and conduct ourselves worse, if we were to trust implicitly to poetical analogies. Our affoctions,” continued Lady Anne, “ arise from circumstances totally independent of our will."" “ That is the very thing I meant to say,” interrupted Belinda, eagerly. They are excited by the agreeable or useful qualities that we discover in things or in persons."" “Undoubtedly,” said Belinda. “ Or by those which our fancies discover,” said Lady Anne. Belinda was silent; but, after a pause, she said, “ That it was certainly very dangerous, especially for women, to trust to fancy in bestowing their affections."" “And yet,” said Lady Anne, “it is a danger to which they are much exposed in society. Men have it in their power to assume the appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable, and women have scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit.” « Without Ithuriel's spear, how can they distinguish the good from the evil ?” said Belinda. “This is a commonplace complaint, I know; the ready excuse that we silly young women plead, when we make mistakes for which our friends reproach us, and for which we too often reproach ourselves."" “ The complaint is commonplace precisely because it is general and just,” replied Lady Anne. “In the slight and frivolous intercourse, which fashionable belles usually have with those fashionable beaux who call themselves their lovers, it is surprising that they can discover any thing of each other's real character. Indeed they seldom do; and this probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy marriages. A woman who has an opportunity of seeing her lover in private society, in domestic life, has infinite advantages; for if she has any sense, and he has  BELINDA. 11 any sincerity, the real character of both may perhaps be developed."" “ True,” said Belinda (who now suspected that Lady Anne alluded to Mr. Vincent); "" and in such a situation a woman would readily be able to decide whether the man who addressed her would suit her taste or not; so she would be inexcusable if, either from vanity or coquetry, she disguised her real sentiments.” “ And will Miss Portman, who cannot by any one to whom she is known, be suspected"

You may read of these in books of travels, told in a manner that I cannot aspire to rival. I must be content with speaking of the general effect, as it related to myself. “I remember waking early in the morning, and from my window, which looked over the Adriatic sea, I saw the sun struggling onwards in a sea of vapor. His track appeared nearly in the point of Trieste. The waters of the gulf lay silent, stretching away south and north, a melancholy plain without life or motion. I began to augur ill of the Venetian festival, but I was agreeably disappointed. For in about an hour the god of day threw off his cloudy bondage, and looked out upon us like, what he really is in southern climates, the living wonder and paragon of the heavens. The wind began to stir and freshen, and the waves curled and broke along the shore. The distant mountains, which had before looked cold and mournful, awoke to a new life, and put on their richest colors. The people opened their windows, there was a hum of voices and laughing, and the splashing of water in the canals below. One after one, the little boats and gondolas shot out from creeks and corners, and shook their tiny streamers to the breeze; men and women, in new gay dresses, were seen; rowers and gondolieri, and holi 132 A DAY IN Wenice. day-making girls from the neighboring continent, while the servants seemed to go about blithely on their morning errands.

The monarch was expected in a few days; for in the midst of his various occupations, Frederick, who was at this time extremely intent upon the establishment of the porcelain manufactory at Berlin, found leisure, frequently, to inspect it in person. The king, however, was prevented from coming at the appointed hour by a review at Potzdam. His majesty had formed the singular project of embodying, and training to the sci- . ence of arms, the Jews in his dominions.* They were. rather awkward in learning the manual exercise; and the Jewish review, though it afforded infinite amusement to the spectators, put Frederick so much out of humour, that, as soon as it was over, he rode to his palace of Sans-Souci, and shut himself up for the remainder of the morning. The preceding evening an English traveller, who had passed some time at Paris with the count de Lauragais, in trying experiments upon porcelain clays, and who had received much instruction on this subject from Mr. Wedgewood of Etruria, had been presented to the king, and his majesty had invited him to be present at a trial of some new processes of importance, which was to be made this morning at his manufactory. The English traveller, who was more intent upon his countryman's fame than upon the martial manœuvres of the Jews, proceeded, as soon as the review was finished, to exhibit his English specimens to a party of gentlemen, who had appointed to meet him at the china-works at Berlin. Of this party was a young man by the name of Augustus Laniska, who was, at this time, scarcely seventeen years old. He was a Pole. by birth-a Prussian by education. He had been bred up at the military * Wraxhall's Memoirs of the Court of Berlin.

His admiration, however, was neither blind nor servile. He saw Frederick's faults, as well as his great qualities; and he often expressed himself with more openness and warmth upon this subject, than prudence could justify. He had conversed, with unusual freedom, about Frederick's character with our English traveller; and whilst he was zealous to display every proof of the king's greatness of mind, he was sometimes forced to acknowledge, that “there are disadvantages in living under the power of a despotic sovereign.” ""A despotic sovereign! You will not then call your Frederick a despot ??? whispered the English traveller to the young Pole, as they entered the china-works at Berlin.-"" This is a promising manufactory, no doubt,"" continued he, “and Dresden china will, probably, soon be called Berlin china, by which the world in general will certainly be much benefited."

However, with many writhings and gruntings the letter was indited, and Jock was as much wearied out as if he had taken a long walk, so that his mother feared that Engelberg was going to disagree with him. He had not energy enough to go out in the evening of Saturday to meet the new arrivals, but stayed with Armine, who was in a state of restless joy and excitement, marvelling at him, and provoking him by this surprise as if it were censure. With his forehead against the window, Armine watched and did his utmost to repress the eagerness that seemed to irritate his brother, and at last gave vent to an irrepressible hurrah. ""There they are! Cecil has got his sister! Oh! and there she is! Babie—holding on to mother, and that must be Mrs. Evelyn with Fordham—and there's Elf making up already to the Doctor! Aren't you coming down, Jock?"" ""Not I! I don't want to see you make a fool of yourself before everybody !—I say—you'll have to come up stairs again, you know! Shut the door I say!""—shouted Jock, as he found Armine deaf to all his expostulations, and then getting up, he banged it himself, and then shuffling back to the sofa, put his hands over his face and exclaimed, ""There! What an eternal brute I am!"" A few moments more and the door was open again, and Cecil, with his arm round his sister, thrust her forwards, exclaiming— ""Here he is, Syd."" Jock had recovered his gentlemanly manners enough to shake hands courteously, as well as to receive and return Babie's kiss, when she and Armine staggered in together, reeling under their weight of delight. Janet kissed him too, and then, scanning both brothers, observed to her mother— ""I think Lucas is the more altered of the two.""  332 MAGNUM BONUM; In which sentiment Elvira seemed to agree, for she put her hands behind her and exclaimed— ""O Jock, you do look such a fright; I never knew how like Janet you were!"" ""You are letting every one know what a spiteful little Elf you can be,"" returned Janet, indignantly. ""Can't you give poor Jock a kinder greeting?"" Whereupon the Elf put on a cunning look of innocence and said— ""I Bidn't know it was unkind to say he was like you, Janet."" The Evelyn pair had gone—after this introduction of Jock and Sydney—to their own sitting-room, which opened out of that of the Brownlows, and the door was soon unclosed, for the two families meant to make up only one party. The two mothers seemed as if they had been friends of old standing, and Mrs. Evelyn was looking with delighted wonder at her eldest son, who had gained much in flesh and in vigour ever since Dr. Medlicott's last and most successful prescription of a"

So he came home and sat by, while his wife and Mr. Bulfinch did the work for him, and made it evident to him that the frauds had been of long standing, and carried on with the connivance of the coachman, of Gregorio, who had before Mrs. Egremont's arrival acted as house steward, and of the former cook. Indeed, it was the housekeeper whom Mrs. Egremont  218 NUTTIE's FATHER. - [CHAP. had left in charge, whose refusal to connive had brought about the discovery. Gregorio's share in all was sufficiently evident, and Alice's heart leapt with hope. Her husband would be wholly her own if his evil genius were once departed, but Mr. Egremont would not see it. He had no objection to sacrifice the coachman and all his underlings, with the bailiff and his entire family, and felt none of the pity that Alice had for the pretty, silly, half-educated daughters; but as to the valet—Pooh pooh! the poor fellow had been out of the way all this time—whatever he had done had been in the dark, ages long ago, before Bridgefield knew its mistress; he was a foreigner, and that was enough to prevent him from forgathering with the English. It was all their English prejudice. ‘I can show you facts and figures, sir, said Mr. Bulfinch. ‘I daresay, a year or more old. Why, I was an unprotected carcase then—a mere prey—the fellow only did after his kind.” Alice held her tongue then, but made an effort in private. “Indeed, I don't think you know; I am afraid Gregorio is not altered. I found him out in his charges about the wine, and the servants' wages at Nice, only you wouldn't listen.’ “His little perquisites, my dear child ! Come, nonsense, these foreign fellows don't pretend to have the morals you ascribe to the native flunkey—generally without foundation either—they are much of a muchness as to that; but your Frenchman or Italian does it more neatly, and is a dozen times better servant than the other is.’ “But—’ ‘Oh, ay!

But he  XX.] WOLF. 219 knows his manners to you, I hope 7' said Mr. Egremont, with a suddenness that made her wish she could truthfully say he did not. ‘Yes, he always is—is respectful, but somehow I see it is under protest.’ Mr. Egremont laughed. “Rivals—yes, I see; why, you don't consider the sore trial of having a full-grown mistress turned in upon him I Look here, you keep the keys already, but the new fellow at the farm and all the rest of them shall account to you for everything—Gregorio and all. Won't that satisfy you?' ‘'Tis not only the money, but I think Gregorio is a bad—not a good—man.’ ‘Ho, ho! she wants to advertise for a pious footman and coachman eh? No, I thank you, my dear

Where can he have taken them in that direction, except to Mount Wollaston 7 ° “To Mount Wollaston, where the band of that reprobate Morton dwells,” Williams remarked. “Your conjecture startles me, Willem.” “It startles myself, for Roaring Tom would be capable of surrendering them to the king's soldiers. The villain will do any thing for money. But if the two colonels have been taken to Mount Wollaston, the Wampanog has acted falsely to us, and, by heaven's he shall pay for it ! But listen: there is the bell ringing.” The sound of a bell could be distinctly heard from the settlement. Its booming sound seemed to summon to a serious business, and Williams confirmed this by saying, with eyes uplifted to heaven, – “Let us go, then, and may God render his justice visible !” “Certainly,” the old trapper muttered, “and may Thorkil keep his five senses together, for this is probably the most important day of his life.” In the centre of one of those pretty meadows called prairies by the settlers, which extended behind the houses of Providence to the gloomy virgin forest, stood a colossal oak, called the Pilgrims' Oak.  THE TRIAL. 201 A spring bubbling up in the shadow of its branches poured its copious stream through a clumsy tube into a basin of coarsely cut stones, and was called Williams's Spring, because the founder of the colony, when he first reached the spot, quenched his thirst there. This spot was regarded as sacred by the settlers. Here Williams assembled his companions for prayers on the first Sunday after their landing; here he gave the rising colony the name of Providence, and the law, which, to the present day, chiefly forms the constitution of Rhode Island. In all important matters the people assembled at Williams's Spring, under the Pilgrims' Oak. But the oak had never witnessed a more numerous assembly than on this day. In the shade of the tree stood a long table, on either side of which six men, settlers of Providence, were seated. The upper end of the table was occupied by the foreman, Samuel Endicott, a worthy old man, who was the most respected member of the colony, next to the patriarch. At the lower end of the table was a bar, with two chairs opposite each other, inside. The right-hand seat, or that of the accuser, was occupied by Thorkil Wikingson; the left hand, or that of the accused, by Theophilus Eaton. In front of the bar Various groups formed a semicircle. On the right hand side of this semicircle might be noticed De Lussan, Desdemona, Hih–lah-dih, about  202 GOLDEN-HAIR.

While this important revolution had been on the eve of taking place, Charles the Second's affairs seemed to be at a lower ebb than they had almost ever been before, A general insurrection of the Cavaliers had been defeated by Lambert a few months before, and the severe measures which followed had, for the time, totally suppressed the spirit, and almost crushed the party of the Royalists. It was in vain that Charles had made advances to Monk while in Scotland, both through the General's own brother, and by means of Sir John Grenville, one of his nearest and most valued relatives and friends. If Monk's mind was then made up concerning the part which he designed to per LONG PARLIAMENT. 327 form, he, at least, was determined to keep his purpose secret in his own bosom, and declined, therefore, though civilly, to hear any proposition on the part of the banished family. The accounts which the little exiled court received concerning Monk's advance into England were equally disconsolate. All intercourse with the Cavaliers had been carefully avoided by the cloudy and mysterious soldier, in whose hands Fortune seemed to place the fate of the British kingdoms. The general belief was, that Monk would renew, in his own person, the attempt in which Cromwell had succeeded and Lambert had failed, and again place a military commander at the head of the Government and it seemed confirmed by his harsh treatnient of the City. While Charles and his attendants were in this state of despondence, they were suddenly astonished by the arrival from England of a partizan, named Baillie, an Irish Royalist, who had travelled with extreme rapidity to bring the exiled Prince the news of Monk’s decided breach with the remnant of the Long Parliament, and the temper which had been displayed by the City of London when it became public %. listened to the messenger as they would have done to one speaking in a dream. Overwearied and fatigued by the journey, and strongly excited by the importance of the intelligence which he brought them, the officer seemed rather like one under the influence of temporary derangement or intoxication, than the deliberate bearer of great tidings.

He produced also a copy of Monk's letter to the Parliament, to show that the General had completely broken with that body. Other messengers soon confirmed the joyful tidings, and Sir John Grenville was despatched to London in all haste, with full powers to offer the General every thing which could gratify

The tea-bell startled them. Ellen ran up stairs to put away her things, and George passed through the hall in time to offer his arm to Mrs. Royton, and they were soon in a merry chat. Mrs. Royton, from experience, knew the world thoroughly, but was not worldly, for she was a true Christian. She had outlived all her children, but not all her sympathies, and this made her a pleasant companion for the young. The sap was yet green in the old tree. She shared their joys and sorrows, entered into their feelings, always making allowances, although she often sighed over them from the depths of a loving heart.  CHAPTER IV. Our friend, Mr. Casey, had shown symptoms of late which gave Mrs. Walker no little uneasiness. He decidedly had the fever matrimonial upon him, and she was fearful, despite all her endeavors to the contrary, he would one day slip his head into the noose. Now she had a decided objection to this, for she did not wish to abdicate just at present. She, therefore, set her active brain to work to remove the symptoms before Ihey assumed a violent form, knowing as she did that Mr. Ca«ey clung to an idea when it had once possessed him with the tenacity of life. The truth was, that Mr. Casey stood somewhat in awe of his handsome sister. She made his home most comfortable for him, surrounded him with bachelor luxuries, welcomed his friends warmly, was always the hospitable and kind hostess; and they thought Casey the luckiest man in the world to possess such a menage, and have such a sister to preside over it; and when they congratulated him upon his good fortune in this respect, he rubbed his hands and looked very happy. But Mrs. Walker was not merciful to his peculiarities. He seldom talked in her presence without first consulting her eye, and sometimes its light fell so coldly upon him, that it froze the words as they were uttered, and confused him in a painful manner.

A little breeze had sprung up mean138  A VOYAGE OVER-SEAS while from over Newfoundland way, and the heavy rolls of mist rose slowly and went scurrying off to leeward, leaving the fair little French town of St. Pierre all uncurtained before us. We exclaimed at the rude beauty of this sudden vision, and I felt, for one, that if even now our quest proved vain, the voyage to such a delightful spot was well worth the time and trouble we had expended upon it. Picture to yourself a village of about three thousand souls nestled near the top of some noble Alpine mountain, far up above the timber line, where there are no trees, no bushes, no verdure of any kind—only bleak, bare, dun-colored rocks that tower a thousand feet or more above the slated roofs and the church steeples. Then let your imagination raise the sea up to the very edge of this Alpine village; dot the tortuous outer harbor with surfsmitten bowlders; place here and there a little white light-house clinging to one of I39  FOUR FOR A FORTUNE these slippery pedestals, crowd the inner basin with hundreds of luggers, barks, and brown-sailed fishing schooners. Such is St. Pierre It is a mountain town in mid-Atlantic.  CHAPTER XIII A B A D START WE took up our lodgings in a quaint little house in a narrow lane of a street that sloped down towards the quays, and we slept peacefully that night in high mahogany bedsteads, under spreading, old-fashioned canopies. No sound disturbed our slumbers after the bold drummer had gone his rounds, rolling out curfew and beating the St. Pierrese to rest; and we were called again to the business of another day by the martial notes of the town-crier's bugle. St. Pierre rises to the clarion and retires to the scolding rumble of a sheepskin. Our first move upon sallying forth was the purchase of a map of the islands; I4I  FOUR FOR A FORTUNE our second, an excursion across the harbor to the Ile aux Chiens. As many dogs, upon so restricted an acreage, I never saw before ; and their friendliness was surpassed only by the good-natured curiosity of the islanders. Rightly was the rock named Dog Island; but, as Thatcher noted, while we searched in vain for the cross mentioned on Carquemort's chart, “The cross seems rather to be in the breed of dogs than concretely erect upon the face of the Cliff.” And, indeed, the comment was zoologically just. For, at a more or less remote period in the history of this colony some one must have imported a dachshund. That dachshund launched into a career of impetuous and reckless paternity, with the result that the influence of his breed is now plainly demonstrate in the forelegs of every cur in town.

Notwithstanding the tremendous physical labor required of them, and forced from them, they thrived under it physically, and acquired under it, despite themselves, what was to them, individually, a fortune. They and the others, the half naked laborers, in mud and rock and sun and shade were not those to whom came the greatest mortality. That came to the men who overlooked them, to the men with transit, and theodolite and pith helmet, to the young, enthusiastic sub-engineers from America and England, all of whom worked careless of 9  130 ARMAGEDDON. hours or weather, many of whom drank too often and too deeply of bad water and strong liquors; and those who died earned fairly, though they lost it, such recompense as came ultimately to those who lived. Ah! but we worked, and we worked all along the line and the onslaught began at the east and midway and upon the Pacific Coast. Before the Musquash had poked her triumphant, but unhandsome nose into the water to assist in transforming it into Brito harbor, there had come from San Francisco all that the great dredge needed in the furtherance of her work, and there had also reached Brito vast supplies and five thousand men. Savage's second in the engineering work, one James Cromwell, fit in force and stubbornness to be ranked with his old namesake Oliver, was there to take command, and there with unlimited resources supplied from San Francisco for use as early as we could make connection across the Isthmus. They made their harbor, Cromwell and his forces, a harbor which was a real one, and they dug and dammed and hurried frantically to meet us when we should have reached the eastern crust, upholding Lake Nicaragua. ""  A HEMISPHERE SPLIT. I31 Their work was as good as ours. Once, just after our temporary transportation system had been established, Cromwell sent to Savage the curt message: “I can use five thousand more men.” He had them within two weeks. He had provided for them, and for their work all things necessary, and he doubled his results. He met us fairly at the down-dip of the western slope. So they fought toward the lake well, those fellows on the Pacific side, and we upon the eastern slope, who were straining every nerve to send to them every day all they could need in their hurrying enterprise, sent to them at the same time jeering and contemptuous comments, telling them that they had not comprehended the first principles of digging canals or riding over mountain crests, or diverting rivers or crossing lakes. In return would come from Cromwell the most insolent and at the same time supplicating messages. He would defy his superiors to their teeth, and in the same breath ask for enormous masses of fresh supplies and working men. Cromwell was a man. He was just the five foot and eight-and-one-half"

Such being the danger in the streets of Rome, it became customary for pedestrians to go provided with stout birchen cudgels, armed at one extremity with a short, sharp pikey for the purpose of defending themselves against these demisavage animals.* This cudgel, by a natural substitution of cause for effect, was called cani, the dative singular for canis, which means literally, "" for a dog,"" a more significant and befitting term than which could not have been chosen.

""Hah!"" exclaimed Holloway: ""I remember, the day that I and Lord Rawson called at your house, you were settling accounts, your foreman told us, with a captain of a ship, who was to leave England in a few days: it's well he's not off."" An officer was immediately sent to Mr. Carat's in quest of this captain; but there were great apprehensions that he might have escaped at the first alarm of the search for the jewels. Fortunately, however, he had not been able to get off, as two constables had been stationed at Mr. Carat's house. The officer from Bow-street found him in his own bed-chamber, rummaging a portmanteau for some papers, which he wanted to burn. His papers were seized, and carried along with him before the magistrate. Alderman Holloway knew the captain the moment he was brought into the room, though his dress and whole appearance were very different from what they had been when he had waited upon the alderman some months before this time, with a dismal, plausible story of his own poverty and misfortunes. He had then told him that his mate and he had had a quarrel, upon the voyage from Jamaica; that the mate knew what a valuable cargo he had on board; that just when they got in sight of land, the crew rose upon him; the mate seized him, and by force put him into a boat, and set him ashore. The discovery of the jewels at Mr. Carat's at once overturned the captain's whole story: cunning people often insert something in their narration to make it better, which ultimately tends to convict them of falsehood. The captain having now no other resource, and having the horrors of imprisonment, and the certainty of condemnation upon a public trial, full before him, threw himself, as the only chance that remained for him, upon Mrs. Howard's mercy; confessed that all that he had told her before was false; that his mate and he had acted in concert; that the rising of the crew against him had been contrived between them; that he had received the jewels, when he was set ashore, for his immediate share of the booty; and that the mate had run the  218 THE GOOD AUNT. ship off to Charlestown, to sell her cargo. According to agreement, the captain added, he was to have had a share in the cargo; but the mate had cheated him of that; he had never heard from him, or of him, he would take his oath, from the day he was set ashore, and knew nothing of him or the cargo.

Our affections,” continued Lady Anne, “ arise from circumstances totally independent of our will.” “That is the very thing I meant to say,"" interrupted Belinda, eagerly. “ They are excited by the agreeable or useful qualities that we discover in things or in persons.” “ Undoubtedly,” said Belinda. “Or by those which our fancies discover,” said Lady Anne. Belinda was silent; but, after a pause, she said, “ That it was certainly very dangerous, especially for women, to trust to fancy in bestowing their affections.” “And yet,"" said Lady Anne, “it is a danger to which they are much exposed in society. Men have it in their power to assume the appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable, and women have scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit.” “Without Ithuriel's spear, how can they distinguish the good from the evil ?” said Belinda. “This is a common-place complaint, I know; the ready excuse that we silly young women plead, when we make mistakes for which our friends reproach us, and for which we too often reproach ourselves."" “The complaint is common-place precisely because it is general and just,” replied Lady Anne. “ In the slight and frivolous intercourse, which fashionable belles usually have with those fashionable beaux who call themselves their lovers, it is surprising that they can discover a.: v thing of each other's real character. Indeed they seldom do; and this probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy marriages. A woman who has an opportunity of seeing her lover in private society, in domestic life, has infinite advantages; for if she has any sense, and he has any sincerity, the real character of both may perhaps be developed.” "" True,"" said Belinda (who now suspected that Lady Anne alluded to Mr. Vincent); ""and in such a situation a woman would readily be able to decide whether the man who addressed her would suit her taste or not; so she would be inex BELINDA. 233 cusable if, either from vanity or coquetry, she disguised her real sentiments.” “And will Miss Portman, who cannot, by any one to whom she is known, be suspected of vanity or coquetry, permit me to speak to her with the freedom of a friend ??' Belinda, touched by the kindness of Lady Anne's manner, pressed her hand, and exclaimed, “Yes, dear Lady Anne, speak to me with freedom-you cannot do me a greater favour. No thought of my mind, no secret feeling of my heart, shall be concealed from you."" “Do not imagine that I wish to encroach upon the generous openness of your temper,"" said Lady Anne; ""tell me when I go too far, and I will be silent.

She was a woman of an excellent heart, and absolutely incapable of suspecting that others could be less frank or friendly than herself. She was sometimes led into mistakes by this undistinguishing benevolence; for she imagined that all which appeared wrong would prove right, if properly understood; that there must be some good reason for every thing that seemed to be bad; that every instance of unkindness or insolence was undesigned; and that every quarrel was only a misunderstanding. Possessed by this good-natured kind of wrong-headedness, she frequently did the most provoking, by way of doing the most obliging things imaginable. Upon this principle she would place contending parties by surprise in the very situation which of all others they most wished to avoid, and then give the signal for a pitched battle, by begging the enemies would shake hands with one another. Now she had heard it reported in Yorkshire that there was some coolness between the Elmours and Miss Turnhall; but she was morally certain there could be no truth in this report, for a variety of the very best reasons in the world. ""In the first place,"" argued Mrs. Wynne, ""to my certain knowledge, Miss Turnbull was, from her infancy, always the greatest favourite at Elmour Grove, the pupil of the good old gentleman, and the intimate friend of the daughter. During that odd Hodgkinson's lifetime, Almeria was always with Miss Ellen Elmour, who treated her quite like a sister. I am sure I  ALMER1A. 225 remember, as if it was yesterday, her introducing Miss Turnbull to me, and the affectionate way in which she spoke of her—and I particularly recollect hearing Almeria Turnbull, amongst other grateful things, say, that she should wish to live and die with her friends at Elmour Grove. Then she had stronger reasons afierwards for being attached to them—you know it was Mr. Frederick Elmour who gaiiwd her large fortune for her. I was in the court-house in Yora. the very day the cause was decided, and I never heard a man speak with more energy and eloquence than Frederick Elmour did in her defence. It was plain, indeed, that the eloquence came from his heart—as to the law part of the business, I know my nephew, who understands those things, said it was a very nice question, and that if her cause had not been managed as ably as it was, she would not have gained her fortune. Now of course this was a thing that never could be forgotten. I own, I expected that there would have been a match between Miss Turnbull and Mr. Elmour; but Sir Thomas Stock, her guardian, took her away from us, and Mr. Elmour fell in love with another lady. But all this time Miss Turnbull has never married, though she has been so much in the great world, and from her large fortune must have had so many offers. I heard it said yesterday, that she"

The word illegal, pronounced in a tremendous tone, operated instantaneously upon the Jew; his hand, which had closed upon Holloway's guineas, opened; he laid the money down upon the table, but mechanically seized his box of trinkets, which he seemed to fear would be the next seized, as forfeits. No persons are so apprehensive of injustice and fraud as those who are themselves dishonest. Mr. Carat, bowing repeatedly to Alderman Holloway, shuffled toward the door, asking if he might now depart; when the door opened with such a force, as almost to push the retreating Jew upon his face. Little Oliver, out of breath, burst into the room, whispered a few words to Dr. B. and Alderman Holloway, who answered, ""He may come in;"" and a tall, stout man, an officer from Bowstreet, immediately entered. ""There's your man, sir,"" said the alderman, pointing to the Jew; ""there is Mr. Carat."" The man instantly seized Mr. Carat, producing a warrant from Justice for apprehending the Jew upon suspicion of his having in his possession certain valuable jewels, the property of Mrs. Frances Howard. Oliver was eager to explain. ""Do you know, Howard,"" said he, ""how all this came about? Do you know your aunt's gone to Bow-street, and has taken the mulatto woman with her, and Mr. Russell is gone with her? and she thinks—and / think— she'll certainly have her jewels, her grandmother's jewels, that were left in Jamaica."" ""How? but how?"" exclaimed Howard. ""Why,"" said Oliver, ""by the toothpick-case. The reason i chose that toothpick-case out of the Jew's box was, because it came into my head, the minute I saw it, that the mulatto woman's curious thimble—you remember her thimble, Howard —would just fit one end of it. I ran home and tried it, and tha thimble screwed on as nicely as possible; and the chasing, a*  THE GOOD AUNT. 215 Mr. Russell said, and the colour of the gold, matched exactly. Oh! Mrs. Howard was so surprised when we showed it to her —so astonished to see this toothpick-case in England; for it had been left, she said, with all her grandmother's diamonds and things, in Jamaica."" ""Yes,"" interrupted Howard; ""I remember my aunt told us, when you asked her about Cuba's thimble, that she gave it to Cuba when she was a child, and that it belonged to some old trinket.—Go on."" ""Well, where was I? Oh, then, as soon as she saw the toothpick-case, she asked how it had been found; and I told her all about the lottery and Mr. Carat; then she and Mr. Kussell consulted, and away they went, with Cuba, in a coach; and all the rest you know; and I wish I could hear the end of it!"" ""And so ycu shall, my good little fellow; we'll all go together to hear the Jew's examination: you shall go with me in my coach"

NOT WANTED BLUE-STOCKINGISM. On leaving Mrs. Gurdy's, Ellen directed her steps to their former home in Wry Lane. It seemed strange to ring the bell, instead of opening the door with a latch-key and entering at once, as had been formerly her custom. A prim and somewhat antiquated damsel, with a painful hesitancy in her speech, and a chill and formal mannerism in her whole appearance, made herself visible, and stammered forth an iuquiry as to Ellen's business. ""I believe it is Miss Ruggles to whom I have the pleasure of 'speaking,"" Ellen asserted rather doubfmgly, for she had obtained  228 THE MERCHANT-MECHANIC. bat transient glimpses of their eccentric landlady in all the years they bad dwelt under the same roof with her. Indeed, so shy bad she been of meeting her lodgers, that she had taken every precaution to avoid so doing; even going so far as to slip Mr. Leroy's rent-bills under his door, with the written request that he would deposit the amount thereof in a closed box on the entry-table. Miss Ruggles gave a stiff little bow, in answer to Ellen's observation. ""I wish to speak with you a few moments, if you are- at leisure."" ""Well, I am very busy/' replied Miss Ruggles, fidgeting with her knitting-sheath; ""but I can wait a few moments if yon've anything particular to say."" ""May I come in, then? You will be apt to take cold standing in this chill wind."" » The faded spinster looked half inclined to shut the door in her visitor's face; but after a second resort to her knitting-sheath, requested Ellen to enter, leading her unwelcome guest through the old-fashioned hall, which she had just time to remark had much improved in appearance during her absence, into the smallest and neatest of sitting-rooms. The floor was nearly covered with braided rugs, on one of which lay a blind cat and a superannuated poodle, in drowsy companionship. In obedience to a look from Miss Ruggles, warning her to be as expeditious as possible, Ellen hastened to make known the object of her call, by asking if either of the rooms they had formerly occupied were at present vacant. ""Not just at present; but the prospects are that they may be in the course of a month or so."" ""Could you tell me exactly when?"" ""I could not."" ""They are now occupied?"" ""They are."" Miss Ruggles grew quite red in the face; whimsically conscious of her own curtness, she wae yet unable to subdue it.
